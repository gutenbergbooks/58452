<p>It is authoritatively stated that the building and maintenance
of the farm fences in the United States have cost more than the
construction of the farm buildings. Be this as it may, while large
numbers of works have been written upon rural architecture we
believe this is the first publication specially devoted to Fences,
Gates and Bridges. It aims to be a practical work, showing the
&#8220;evolution&#8221; of the fence from the road barrier of logs,
brush or sods to the latest improved forms of barbed wire. The numerous
illustrations are mainly representations of fences, gates, etc., in
actual use. The chapter on fence law is necessarily condensed. The
various judicial decisions upon the subject alone would fill a large
volume.</p>

<p>This little work, the first and only one of its character, is given
to the public in the confident hope that it will prove specially useful
to farmers and village residents.</p>

<p>The zigzag rail fence was almost universally adopted by the settlers
in the heavily timbered portions of the country, and countless
thousands of miles of it still exist, though the increasing scarcity
of timber has brought other styles of fencing largely into use.
Properly built, of good material, on a clear, solid bed, kept free
from bushes and other growth to shade it and cause it to rot, the
rail fence is as cheap as any, and as effective and durable as can
reasonably be desired. Good chestnut, oak, cedar, or juniper rails, or
original growth heart pine, will last from fifty to a hundred years,
so that material of this sort, once in hand, will serve one or two
generations. This fence, ten rails high, and propped with two rails
at each corner, requires twelve rails to the panel. If the fence bed
is five feet wide, and the rails are eleven feet long, and are lapped
about a foot at the locks, one panel will extend about eight feet in
direct line. This takes seven thousand nine hundred and twenty rails,
or about eight thousand rails to the mile. For a temporary fence,
one that can be put up and taken down in a <span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_8">Page&nbsp;8</a></span> short time, for making stock pens
and division fences, not intended to remain long in place, nothing
is cheaper or better. The bed for a fence of this kind should not be
less than five feet across, to enable it to stand before the wind. The
rails are best cut eleven feet long, as this makes a lock neither too
long nor too short; and the forward end of each rail should come under
the next one that is laid. The corners, or locks, as they are called,
should also be well propped with strong, whole rails, not with pieces
of rails, as is often done. The props should be set firmly on the
ground about two feet from the panel, and crossed at the lock so as to
hold each other, and the top course of the fence firmly in place. They
thus act as braces to the fence, supporting it against the wind. Both
sides of the fence should be propped. The top course of rails should be
the strongest and heaviest of any, for the double purpose of weighting
the fence down, and to prevent breaking of rails by persons getting
upon it. The four courses of rails nearest the ground should be of the
smallest pieces, to prevent making the cracks, or spaces between the
rails, too large. They should also be straight, and of nearly even
sizes at both ends. This last precaution is only necessary where small
pigs have to be fenced out or in, as the case may be. The fence, after
it is finished, will have the appearance of <a href="#fig001">figure
1</a>, will be six rails high, two props at each lock, and the worm
will be crooked enough to stand any wind, that will not prostrate
crops, fruit trees, etc. A straighter worm than this will be easy to
blow down or push over. The stability of this sort of fence <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">Page&nbsp;9</a></span> depends very
largely on the manner of placing the props, both as to the distance
of the foot of the prop rail from the fence panel, and the way it is
locked at the corner.</p>

   <h3>LAYING A RAIL FENCE.</h3>

</div>

<p>It is much better, both for good looks and economy, to have the
corners of a rail fence on each side in line with each other. This
may be accomplished by means of a very simple implement, shown in
<a href="#fig002">figure 2</a>. It consists of a small pole, eight
feet long, sharpened at the lower end. A horizontal arm of a length
equal to half the width of the fence from extreme outside of corners,
is fastened to the long pole at right angles, near the lower end.
Sometimes a sapling may be found with a limb growing nearly at right
angles, which will serve the purpose. Before beginning the fence,
stakes are set at intervals along the middle of the line it is to
occupy. To begin, the gauge, as shown in <a href="#fig002">figure
2</a>, is set in line with the stakes, and the horizontal arm is
swung outwardly at right angles to the line of fence. A stone or
block to support the first corner is laid directly under the end
of the horizontal arm, and the first rail laid with one end<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">Page&nbsp;10</a></span>
resting on the support. In the same way the next corner and all others
are laid, the gauge being moved from corner to corner, set in the line
of fence, and the arm swung alternately to the right and left.</p>

<p>A neater and more substantial method of securing the corners
of a worm fence is by vertical stakes and wires, as shown in the
accompanying illustrations. When the lower three rails are laid, the
stakes are driven in the angles close to the rails, and secured by a band
of annealed wire. The work of laying the rails proceeds, and when
within one rail of the top, a second wire band is put in place. Or the
upper wire may be put on above the top rail. Annealed wire is plentiful
and cheap.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p>A very common method with the &#8220;worm&#8221; or
&#8220;Virginia&#8221; rail fence is to drive slanting stakes over
the corner in saw-horse style, and lay the top rail into the angle
thus formed. The stakes, resting on the rails and standing at angle,
brace the fence firmly. But the feet of the stakes extending beyond
the jagged corners formed by the ends of the rail are objectionable.
This is remedied in part by putting the stakes over the middle of
the panel&#8212;at considerable distance apart&#8212;and laying in
them long poles horizontally. In this case the stakes should be set
at such an angle as to prevent their moving sidewise along the top
rail, which should be a strong one. These stakes and long riders
are frequently used to raise the height of low stone walls. <a
href="#fig006">Figure 6</a> shows a fence nearly all composed of stakes
and riders, which is straight and requires fewer rails than a worm
fence. First, crotched stakes, formed by the forks of a branching tree
limb, a foot or more long, are driven a foot or so into the ground
at a distance apart corresponding to the length of poles used. The
bottom poles are laid into these, and two<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_12">Page&nbsp;12</a></span> stakes, split or round poles, are
driven over these and the next poles laid in. Then two more stakes
and another pole, and so on as high as the fence is required. This
will answer for larger animals, and be strong and not expensive. For
swine, and other small livestock, the crotch stakes may be replaced by
blocks or stones, and the lower poles be small and begin close to the
ground.</p>

modification of this fence is sometimes made by using withes instead of
pins to hold the poles in place. The withe is made of a young sapling
or slender limb of beech, iron-wood, or similar tough fibrous wood,
with the twigs left on. This is twisted upon itself, a strong loop made
at the top, through which the butt is slipped. When in place, the butt
end is tucked under the body of the withe.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 11.&#8212;Side View Of Fence.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The main point in such a fence is either to set the posts and
place a pin through them near the bottom, so that the frost may
not throw them out, or to so attach the<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_14">Page&nbsp;14</a></span> boards that the
posts may be re-driven, without splitting them, or removing the rails
from the fence. The latter is, perhaps, the best plan, and may be
accomplished in several ways, the most desirable of which is shown in
<a href="#fig010">figures 10</a> and <a href="#fig011">11</a>. The
post, <em>h</em>, is driven in the usual manner, when a strip of board,
<em>g</em>, is fastened to it by three or four spikes, depending upon
the hight of the fence. A space just sufficient to insert the ends
of boards <em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, <a href="#fig011">figure 11</a>,
is left between the post and outside strip, the ends of the boards
resting upon the spikes. Many<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_15">Page&nbsp;15</a></span> miles of this fence are in use. It
looks neat; besides any portion is easily removed, making a passage to
and from the field. A new post is easily put in when required, and any
may be re-driven when heaved by the frost.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig012">

        alt="fence rails held by iron hooks" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 12.&#8212;Fence With Iron Hooks.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Where iron is cheap, a rod about three-eighths of an inch in
diameter is cut in lengths of about seven and a half inches; one
end is sharpened, while the opposite end, for three inches, is bent
at right angles. After the boards are placed in position, the hooks
should be driven in so that they will firmly grasp the boards and hold
them in place. The general appearance of the finished fence is shown
in <a href="#fig012">figure 12</a>, and is one adapted to almost any
locality.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig013">

        alt="rails bolted to post" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 13.&#8212;Horizontal Section.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A much better method is to fasten the boards temporarily in place,
and then bore a half inch hole through both boards and the post, into
which a common screw bolt is then inserted and the nut screwed on
firmly. The two ends should, however, be put on opposite sides of the
post. One bolt thus holds the ends of both boards firmly to the post,
as shown in <a href="#fig013">figure 13</a>. With this style of fence,
old rails or round poles may be used instead of boards.</p>

<div class="section">
   <h3>OTHER PRIMITIVE FENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>In the heavily timbered parts of the country, where the settlers a
few years ago were making farms by felling and burning the huge pine
trees, a fence was constructed<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_16">Page&nbsp;16</a></span> like the one shown in <a
href="#fig014">figure 14</a>. Sections of trees, about four and a half
feet long and often as thick, were placed in line and morticed to
receive from three to five rails. This style of fence could be used
by the landscape gardener with fine effect for enclosing a park or
shrubbery.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Fig. 14.&#8212;Log Posts.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the same regions, when a farmer has pulled all the
stumps from a pasture that slopes toward the highway,
the stumps may be placed in line along the road with
the top ends inside of the field. The gaps between
where the stumps cannot be rolled close together, are
filled with brushwood. A portion of this fence is shown
in <a href="#fig015">figure 15</a>.</p>

<p>Where other material is costly, or not to be obtained,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">Page&nbsp;17</a></span>
the wicker fence, constructed of stakes and willows, is much used.
In the far West it is to be seen in every town, generally built on a
small embankment of earth from one to two feet deep. In this climate,
with occasional repairs, it lasts from ten to fifteen years. <a

</div>

<p>To build a stone wall, some skill is required. The foundation
should be dug out a foot deep, and the earth thrown upon each side,
which serves to turn water from the wall. Large stones are bedded in
the trench, and long stones placed crosswise upon them. As many whole
stones as possible should be used in this place. The stones are then
arranged as shown in the engraving, breaking joints, and distributing
the weight equally. Any small spaces should be filled with chips broken
off in dressing the larger stones, so as to make them fit snugly. As it
is a work that will last a century, it is worth doing well.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 19.&#8212;Laying Up A Stone Fence.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A permanent stone fence should be built from four to five feet
high, two feet wide at the base and one foot at the top, if the kind
of stones available allow this construction.<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_19">Page&nbsp;19</a></span> If a higher fence is desired,
the width should be correspondingly increased. The surface of the
soil along the line of the fence should be made smooth and as nearly
level as possible. The hight will depend upon the situation, the
animals, the smoothness of the wall (whether sheep can get foot-holds
to climb over), and the character of the ground along each side. If
the earth foundation be rounded up previously, sloping off to an open
depression or gully, less hight will be needed. Such an elevation
will furnish a dry base not heaved by frost like a wet one. Without
this, or a drain alongside or under the wall, to keep the soil always
dry, the base must be sunk deeply enough to be proof against heavy
frosts, which will tilt and loosen the best laid wall on wet soil.
The foundation stones should be the largest; smaller stones packed
between them are necessary to firmness. The mistake is sometimes made
of placing all the larger stones on the outside of the wall, filling
the center with small ones. Long bind-stones placed at frequent
intervals through the wall add greatly to its strength. The top of the
fence is most secure when covered with larger<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_20">Page&nbsp;20</a></span> close-fitting, flat stones. The
engraving shows a wooden frame and cords used as a guide in building
a substantial stone fence. Two men can work together with mutual
advantage on opposite sides of the stone wall.</p>

<p>The small truck (<a href="#fig020">figure 20</a>) is not expensive,
and may be made to save a great amount of hard lifting in building a
stone wall. It is a low barrow, the side bars forming the handles like
a wheel-barrow. It rests upon four low iron wheels. A broad plank, or
two narrow ones, are laid with one end against the wall and the other
resting on the ground. A groove is cut at the upper end for the wheels
to rest in. The stone is loaded on the truck, moved to the place, and
pushed up the plank until the wheels fall into the groove; when, by
lifting on the handles, the stone is unloaded.</p>

through the soft earth, and a board fence, only three boards high, made

the field, strengthens the ridge, prevents the growth of weeds, and

</div>

<p>A sod fence, beside its other value, is a double barrier against the
prairie fires which are so sweeping and destructive to new settlers, if
unobstructed, for a wide strip is cleared of sods, the fence standing
in the middle of it. A very convenient implement for cutting the sod
is shown at <a href="#fig023">figure 23</a>. It is made of planks
and scantling, the method of construction being clearly shown. The
cutting disks are four wheel-coulters from common breaking plows, all
attached to an iron shaft sixteen inches apart. They are set to cut
three or four inches deep. This is run three times along the line
of the fence, making nine cuts, the cutters being held down by a
man riding on the rear of the apparatus. Then with a breaking<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">Page&nbsp;23</a></span> plow one furrow
is turned directly in the line of the fence, completely inverting the
sod, the team turned to the right, and a second or back-furrow is
inverted on top of the first. Additional furrows are cut, diminishing
in width to five or six inches on the outer side, as shown in the
diagram, <a href="#fig024">figure 24</a>. After the two inner sods
are turned, the rest are carried by hand, wheel-barrow or a truck, (<a
href="#fig020">figure 20</a>), and laid on the sod wall, care being
used to &#8220;break joints&#8221; and to taper gradually to the top.
If a more substantial fence is wanted, a strip thirty-two inches wide
may be left as a part for the fence, the first two furrows inverted
upon the uncut portion, so that their edges just touch. The sod fence
is then continued to the summit just twice as thick as it would be by
the process just described. After the fence is laid, a deep furrow
should be run on each side, throwing the earth against the base of the
fence. A very effective and cheap fence is made by laying up a sod
&#8220;dyke,&#8221; as above described, three feet high, then driving
light stakes along the summit, and stringing two strands of barbed wire
to them.</p>

<h3>BUILDING BOARD FENCES.</h3>

      <p>Fig. 25.&#8212;Properly Constructed Board Fence.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>In building a board fence, always start right, and it will be little
trouble to continue in the same way. Much of the board fencing erected
is put together very carelessly, and the result is a very insecure
protection to the field or crops. A fence-post should be set two and
a half or three feet in the ground, and the earth should be packed
around it as firmly as possible. For packing the soil there is nothing
better than a piece of oak, about three inches square on the lower
end, and about six feet long, rounded off on the upper part to fit
the hands easily. Properly used, this instrument will pack the soil
around a post as it was before the hole was dug. In putting on fence
boards, most builders use two nails on the ends of each board, and one
in the middle. Each board should have at least <em>three</em> nails
at the ends, and <em>two</em> in the middle, and these nails should
never be less than ten-pennys. Smaller nails will hold the boards in
place for awhile, but when they begin to warp, the nails are drawn out
or loosened, and the boards drop off. This will rarely be the case
where large nails are used, and a much stiffer fence is secured. Many
fence builders do not cut off the tops of the posts evenly, but this
should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">Page&nbsp;25</a></span>
always be done, not only for the improvement that it makes in the
looks of the fence; but also for the reason that there should always
be a cap put on, and to do this, the posts must be evened. The joints
should always be &#8220;broken,&#8221; as is shown in the engraving,
<a href="#fig025">figure 25</a>, so that in a four-board fence but
two joints should come on each post. By this means more firmness and
durability is secured, there being always two unbroken boards on each
post to hold it in place, preventing sagging. On the face of the post
immediately over where the rails have been nailed on, nail a flat piece
of board the width of the post and extending from the upper part of the
top rail to the ground.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 26.&#8212;A Durable Board Fence.</p></div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig026">Figure 26</a> shows a slight modification, which
consists in setting the posts on alternate sides of the boards,
securing additional stability. The posts are seven feet long, of well
seasoned red cedar, white oak, chestnut, or black locust, preference
being accorded to order named. The boards are sixteen feet long,
fastened with ten-penny steel fence nails. The posts for a space
of two and a half feet from the lower end are given a good coat of
boiled linseed oil and pulverized charcoal, mixed to the consistency
of ordinary paint, which is allowed to dry before they are set. When
the materials are all ready, stretch a line eighteen inches above
the ground, where it is proposed to build the fence. Dig the post
holes, eight feet apart from centers, on alternate sides of the line.
The posts are set with the faces inward, each half an inch from the
line, to allow space for the boards. Having<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_26">Page&nbsp;26</a></span> set the posts, the
boards of the lower course are nailed on. Then, for the first length,
the second board from the bottom and the top board are only eight
feet long, reaching to the first post. For all the rest the boards
are of the full length, sixteen feet. By this means they &#8220;break
joints.&#8221; After the boards are nailed on, the top of the posts are
sawed off slanting, capped, if desired, and the whole thing painted.
A good coat of crude petroleum, applied before painting, will help
preserve the fence, and save more than its cost in the paint needed.</p>

<p>We see another style of board fence now and then that is rather
preferable to the ordinary one; it looks better than the old straight
fence. It saves one board to each length; and by nailing on the two
upper boards, as shown in the illustration, <a href="#fig027">figure
27</a>, great extra strength is given. These boards not only act
as braces, but ties also, and a fence built on well set posts, and
thoroughly nailed, will never sag or get out of line until the posts
rot off.</p>

A two and a half by two and a half inch piece of the desired length

fence, or plenty of straight saplings, the old method is still a very
cheap and convenient one.</p>

<p>The engraving, <a href="#fig039">figure 39</a>, represents a good,
substantial garden fence, that, while somewhat more serviceable than
the ordinary kind, may be constructed at less cost. It does not
materially differ from the common picket fence, further than that the
pickets are put five inches apart, with strips of lath nailed between.
The pickets give the necessary strength, while the lath, as a shield
against poultry, or rabbits and other vermin, is equally as good at
one-sixth the cost. An old picket fence surrounding a garden or yard,
may be &#8220;lathed&#8221; in the manner here indicated at little
expense.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 41.&#8212;Bench For Sawing Pickets.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The picket fence in very general use in the Southern States,
is shown in <a href="#fig040">figure 40</a>. It will be observed
that the pickets, instead of terminating in an equal-sided<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">Page&nbsp;32</a></span>
point, have but one slanting side, while the other is straight.
Such a fence looks quite as well as one with the other style of
points, and is exceedingly neat and serviceable along the line of the
street, or to mark the boundary between two estates. To facilitate
the sawing of the pickets, the bench or horse represented in <a
href="#fig041">figure 41</a> is employed. This has a stop at one end,
while near the other end are two upright pieces to serve as guides
in sawing. The edge of one of these is far enough in the rear of the
other to give the desired slope. In sawing,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_33">Page&nbsp;33</a></span> the saw rests
against these guides, as shown by the dotted lines. In a picket fence,
the point where decay commences, is where the pickets cross the string
pieces. Water enters between the two, and decay takes place which
is unsuspected until the breaking of a picket reveals the state of
affairs. The string pieces and the pickets, at least upon one side,
should be painted before putting them together, and nailed while the
paint is fresh.</p>

   <h3>FENCES OF SPLIT PICKETS.</h3>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 43.&#8212;Cheap Fence Of Split Timber.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In localities where sawed timber is expensive, and split timber is
readily obtained, a very neat picket fence may be made with very little
outlay, by using round posts, split stringers, and rived pickets, as
shown in the engraving, <a href="#fig042">figure 42</a>. The stringers
are eight to twelve feet in length, and usually one of the flat sides
is sufficiently smooth for receiving the pickets. Let the stringers
project a few inches beyond each post, adding strength to the fence,
and should the posts decay, new ones may be driven in on either side,
and the stringers readily attached by heavy nails or spikes. With
timber that splits freely, a man can rive out five or six hundred
pickets in a day. The construction of the fence is plainly shown in the
above engraving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">Page&nbsp;34</a></span></p>
<p><a href="#fig043">Figure 43</a> represents a fence made entirely of
split timber, the only cash outlay being for nails. This may be made so
as to turn, not only all kinds of stock, but rabbits, etc. The pickets
are sharpened, and driven six or eight inches into the ground, and
firmly nailed to a strong string-piece at top.</p>

</div>

<p>Another good substantial fence is represented by <a
href="#fig044">figure 44</a>, which, though somewhat expensive, is
especially adapted for yard, orchard and vineyard enclosure. This needs
no explanation. The posts should not be set further than eight feet
apart; two by four-inch scantlings should be used to nail to, and split
palings should be nailed on with annealed steel nails.</p>

pieces between the pickets may be painted some other color than the
fence, if so desired. Any carpenter should be able to construct it at a
small advance over a fence made from plain pickets, making the pattern
as in <a href="#fig046">figure 46</a>.</p>

<p>When the farmers on the prairies prevent the spreading of the
prairie fires, young oak and hickory saplings spring up as if by magic
near all the wooded streams. These saplings come from huge roots whose tops
have yearly been destroyed by fire. In that section farmers often
construct a very neat rustic fence from two or three year old saplings,
having the appearance of <a href="#fig048">figure 48</a>. The rustic
pickets are trimmed so as to leave the branches projecting about two
inches, and are nailed on with four-penny nails. A fence of this kind
would not last long, unless the pickets, posts, and rails were free of
bark, or saturated with crude petroleum.</p>

<p>A very neat and picturesque fence for a garden or a lawn is shown at
<a href="#fig049">figure 49</a>. It is made of round poles, with the
bark on, the posts being of similar material.<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_37">Page&nbsp;37</a></span> Three horizontal
bars are nailed to the posts at equal intervals, the slats or pickets
woven into them and then nailed in place. One or two coats of crude
petroleum, applied to this and other rustic work at first, and
renewed every year, adds to its appearance and greatly increases its
durability.</p>

</div>

<p>For enclosing poultry yards, garden and grounds, a cheap fence with
pickets of lath often serves a good purpose. If not very durable, the
cost of repair or renewal is light. <a href="#fig050">Figure 50</a>
shows one of this kind, which is sufficiently high for the Asiatic and
other heavy and quiet fowls. The panels are sixteen feet long, and are composed
of two pieces of ordinary six-inch fencing, for top and bottom rails,
with lath nailed across two and a half inches apart; the top ends of
the lath extending ten inches above the upper edge of the top rail.
Posts, three or four inches through at the top end, are large enough,
and, after sharpening well, can be driven into the ground by first
thrusting a crow-bar down and wrenching it back and forth. A post is
necessary at the middle of each panel. Both rails of the panel should
be well nailed to the posts. These panels may be neatly and rapidly
made in a frame, constructed for that purpose. This frame, shown in <a
href="#fig051">figure 51</a>, consists simply of three cross-pieces
of six by six, four feet long, upon<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_38">Page&nbsp;38</a></span> which are spiked
two planks one foot wide and three feet apart, from outside to outside.
Four inches from the inner edge of each plank is nailed a straight
strip of inch stuff, to keep the rails of the panel in place while the
lath are being nailed on. Against the projecting ends of the cross-pieces,
spike two by six posts twelve inches long; on the inside of these posts
nail a piece of six-inch fencing, to serve as a stop, for the top ends
of the laths to touch, when nailing them to the rails. These panels can
be made in the shop or on the barn floor at odd times, and piled away
for future use. Nail a wide bottom board around on the inside of the
enclosure after the fence is in position.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig052">Figures 52</a> and <a href="#fig053">53</a>
show lath fences high enough for all kinds of poultry. The posts in
<a href="#fig052">figure 52</a> are eight feet apart. A horizontal
bar is nailed to the posts six inches above the ground, a second one
eighteen inches, and a third four and a half feet. To two lower strips
nail laths that have been cut to half length, first driving the lower
part of the laths two inches into the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_39">Page&nbsp;39</a></span> One advantage of
this fence is, that the two strips near the bottom, being so close
together, sustain pressure from dogs or outside intruders better than
any other fence constructed of lath, and dispenses with a foot-wide
board, so generally used.</p>

<p>The cheapest lath fence is made with the posts four feet apart,
first sawing them in two lengthwise at a sawmill, and nailing the lath
directly to the posts without the use of strips. The two upper laths
have short vertical pieces fastened to them with cleat nails, and
present points to prevent fowls alighting on the fence. Such a fence
(<a href="#fig053">figure 53</a>) will cost, for four feet, one-half
post, three cents; twenty laths, eight cents; and the nails, three
cents, per running foot, six feet high, or one-half cent per square
foot.</p>

</div>

<p>A very desirable and popular fence is made of pickets or slats
woven into horizontal strands of plain wire. Several machines have
been invented and patented for doing this work, but it can be done by
hand with the aid of the bench illustrated herewith. The wire should
be a little larger than that used on harvesting machines, and annealed
like it. The bench, of which <a href="#fig054">figure 54</a> is a
side view, and <a href="#fig055">figure 55</a> a top view, should be
about sixteen feet long and have a screw at each corner for raising
and lowering the holding bars. For the screws at the ends<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">Page&nbsp;40</a></span>
of the frame one-half to three-fourth-inch iron rod will answer. The
wire is twisted close and tight to the slats, and given two or three
twists between them. If the slats are of green stuff, fasten the wire
to them with small staples, to prevent their slipping when they shrink.
The fence is fastened to the post with common fence staples. When
this style of fence is used on one side of a pasture or highway, its
effectiveness may be increased by a single<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_41">Page&nbsp;41</a></span> strand of barbed
wire stapled to the posts above the pickets, and a strand of plain
wire strung along the bottom to stiffen it. The fence will then be as
in <a href="#fig056">figure 56</a>. Such a fence will last many years,
and for most sections of the country is the best and cheapest combined
cattle and hog fence that can be made. For a garden fence it is equal
to the best picket, and at one third of the cost. By having the slats
sawed about one-half inch thick, two inches wide, and five to six feet
long, it makes an excellent fence for a chicken yard, as it can be
readily taken down, moved, and put up again without injuring it in the
least. For situations where appearances are secondary importance, round
slats are equally as good as pickets. A farmer in Wisconsin planted a
few white willow trees the year that he made some fences of this kind.
When the fence began to need repairs, the willows had attained such a
growth that their trimmings furnished all the material needed then and
each year thereafter.</p>

</div>

<p>The fence shown in <a href="#fig057">figure 57</a> has been
introduced in some sections, and is becoming more popular every
year. The posts are set ten feet apart, and are so placed that they will
come on the right and left side of the fence, alternately. The pickets
are split from oak, or any other hard wood, and are four or five feet
long, and an inch and a half or two inches wide. When the posts are
set, brace the one at the end of the line, and<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_42">Page&nbsp;42</a></span> fasten the ends of
two number nine, unannealed wires to it. Stretch the wires along to the
other end of the line, and a few feet beyond the last post. One pair
is to be stretched near the top of the posts and one near the ground.
When the wires are stretched taut, fasten them to some posts or other
weight that will drag on the ground; the upper and lower wires should
be fastened to separate weights, and these should be heavy enough to
keep the wires at a great tension. Having done this, you are ready to
commence building the fence. One man spreads the strands, while another
places the picket between them; the other end of the picket is then
raised up and placed between the upper wires, and then driven up with
an axe or mallet. In inserting the pickets, the wires are to be crossed
alternately, as shown in the engraving. The pickets should be dry and
should be about three inches apart. It takes two persons to build this
fence successfully, but it can be built more rapidly by three; one to
spread the wires, one to place the picket in position, and one to drive
it home. This is especially adapted, for a line or other fence which is
not required to be often moved. It is fastened to the post by nailing
one of the pickets to it with common fencing nails. Fences of this
kind are also made with straight, round limbs of willow or other trees
in place of the split pickets. Several different machines have been
patented for making this style of fence.</p>

   <h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V. <br />BARB-WIRE FENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The invention of barb wire was the most important event in the
solution of the fence problem. The question of providing fencing
material had become serious, even in the timbered portions of the
country, while the great prairie region was almost wholly without
resource, save the slow and expensive process of hedging. At this
juncture came barb wire, which was at once seen to make a cheap,
effective, and durable fence, rapidly built and easily moved. The
original patent for barb wire was taken out in 1868, but it was not
until six years later that an attempt was made to introduce it into
general use, and more than ten years elapsed before the industry
attained any considerable magnitude. The rapidity and extent of its
subsequent growth will be seen by the following table, showing the
estimated amount of barb wire manufactured and in use during the years
named, the estimated length being in miles of single strand:</p>

<p>Barb wire is not without its drawbacks as a fencing material, the
most common one being the liability of serious<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_44">Page&nbsp;44</a></span> injury to valuable
domestic animals coming in contact with the sharp barbs. Many
means have been devised for overcoming this evil. Some of them are
illustrated in the next chapter. The direct advantages of barb wire are:
First&#8212;economy, not only in the comparative cheapness of its
first cost, but also in the small amount of land covered by it.
Second&#8212;effectiveness as a barrier against all kinds of stock,
and a protection against dogs and wild beasts. Third&#8212;rapidity of
construction and ease of moving. Fourth&#8212;freedom from harboring
weeds, and creating snow drifts. Fifth&#8212;durability.</p>

<p>Barb wire, like the harvester, the sowing machine, and most other
valuable inventions, has attained its present form from very crude
beginnings. The original barb wire consisted of double-pointed
metallic discs, strung<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_45">Page&nbsp;45</a></span> loosely upon plain wire. The
next step was to twist this with another wire, as shown in <a
href="#fig058">figure 58</a>.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 61.&#8212;Sterling Barb Wire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another crude beginning was the &#8220;horse-nail barb,&#8221;
which consisted of a common horseshoe nail bent around a plain wire,
and the whole wrapped spirally with a smaller wire, as shown in
<a href="#fig059">figure 59</a>. Various forms of two-pointed and
four-pointed barb wire are manufactured, the principal difference
being the shape of the barbs and the manner of coiling them around one
or both of the strands. A few of the leading styles are illustrated
herewith. <a href="#fig060">Figures 60</a> and <a href="#fig061">61</a>
show two varieties of two-pointed barb wire.</p>

<p>The Glidden patent steel barb wire is made in three styles, as
shown in <a href="#fig065">figures 65</a>, <a href="#fig066">66</a>,
and <a href="#fig067">67</a>. <a href="#fig065">Figure 65</a> shows
the two-point wire, in which, like the others, the barb is twisted
around only one of the wires. <a href="#fig066">Figure 66</a> shows
the &#8220;thick-set&#8221; which has barbs like the other, but
set closer together for such purposes as sheep folds, gardens, or
other places, which require extra protection. The four-point barb
wire, <a href="#fig067">figure 67</a>, has barbs of the same form
as the two other styles, that is a sharply pricking barb attached
to one of the wires of the fence strand, upon which the other wire
is twisted, holding the barb<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_47">Page&nbsp;47</a></span> firmly in place. The barb is at
right angles to the wire, and does not form a hook, but a straight
short steel thorn. A sharp point which inflict an instantaneous prick
repels an animal more safely than a longer and duller barb.</p>

<p>Barb wire of nearly, if not quite all the popular kinds,
is shipped from the factory on strong spools, each holding
one hundred pounds in weight, or eighty rods in length.
These spools are bored through the center to admit a
stick or bar, which can be used as an axle in unreeling
the wire. The following table shows the weight of wire

<p>There is a kind of barb fencing in which flat steel straps are
employed instead of wire. In the form shown in <a href="#fig068">figure
68</a>, the barbs are bent around a plain strap and the whole is then
galvanized, which firmly fixes the barb. Another form shown at <a
href="#fig069">figure 69</a> consists of a solid piece of steel, ribbed
through the middle, and with barbs cut on both edges. These and similar
forms are more expensive than wire, and are employed only in limited
quantities for enclosing lawns, paddocks, etc. Still another form is
like that shown in <a href="#fig070">figure 70</a>, without barbs, and
twisted. This is much used to enclose lawns and ornamental grounds. It
is light, neat and strong, does<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_49">Page&nbsp;49</a></span> not harbor weeds or make snow
drifts, but is comparatively expensive, as five or six strands are
required to make an effective fence.</p>

</div>

<p>The timber for posts should be cut when the sap is dormant.
Midwinter or August is a good time to cut post timber. They should be
split and the bark taken off as soon as possible after cutting the
timber. For end posts, select some of the best trees, about sixteen
inches in diameter, from which take cuts eight and a half feet in
length, splitting them in quarters for brace posts. They should be
set three feet in the ground, which is easily done with a post-hole
digger. When setting the brace posts, take a stone
eighteen inches to two feet long, twelve inches wide, and six inches
thick, which is put down against the post edgewise, on the opposite
side to the brace, as seen in <a href="#fig075">figure 75</a>, putting
it down about even with the surface of the ground. This holds the post
solid against the brace. A heart-rail, ten feet in length makes a good
brace. Put one of the long posts every sixteen or twenty rods along
the line of fence, as they help to strengthen it, and set lighter and
shorter posts along the line about sixteen feet apart. After the posts
are set, two or three furrows should be turned against them on each
side, as it helps to keep stock from the wire. Such a fence should be
built of a good height. It is better to buy an extra wire than have
stock injured. There is no pulling over end-posts or sagging wire.</p>

</div>

<p>To make an extra solid wire fence, brace the posts, as shown in <a
href="#fig076">figure 76</a>, on both sides, in order to resist the
tension in either direction. Every eighth post should be thus braced,
and it makes a mark for measuring the length of the fence, for eight
posts set one rod apart, make eight rods, or a fortieth of a mile for
each braced post. The braces are notched into the top of the posts,
just below the top wire, and a spike is driven through both the brace
and the post. The braces abut upon large stones which give them great
firmness.</p>

</div>

<p>The general introduction of barb wire fencing has brought out a
great variety of devices for handling the wire. One of these is shown
in the illustrations. Two pieces of scantling are attached to the
rear end of a wagon from which the box has been removed, as shown in
<a href="#fig077">figure 77</a>. A slot near the end of each admits
the round stick thrust through the reel of barb wire, to serve as an
axle. The end of the barb wire is fastened to the fence post, the
team in front of the wagon started up, and<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_52">Page&nbsp;52</a></span> some three yards
of wire unreeled. Then the hind axle of the wagon is made fast by a
chain or rope to the nearest fence-post, the hind wheel nearest the
fence lifted from the ground and held there by a wagon-jack or piece of
board. One turn is then made in the barb wire, as shown at <em>A</em>,
<a href="#fig078">figure 78</a>, to which is attached one end of a
piece of smooth wire, some ten feet long. The other end is placed
between two screws, <em>b</em> <em>b</em>, in the end of the hub, as
shown in the illustration. The wire thus fastened is coiled around the
hub, and the operator can tighten it and the barb wire to which it is
attached, by employing the leverage of the spokes and felloes.</p>

</div>

<p>A lighter form of reel holder is shown at <a href="#fig079">figure
79</a>. It is made of two pieces of two by four scantlings fastened
to the axle of a sulky corn plow. They must be placed<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">Page&nbsp;53</a></span>
far enough apart to allow the reel or spool to run between them. Make
a square axle, <a href="#fig080">figure 80</a>, of some hard tough
wood, rounding it where it runs in the slots of the scantling; drive
it through the hole in the spool, and attach the crank. In moving
fence, place the spool on the frame; remove one end of the wire from
the post, fasten it to the spool, and while one man holds the pole
and steers and steadies the sulky&#8212;he will have to pull back a
little&#8212;another turns the spool and winds up the wire. When a
corner is reached, the wire is loosened, the sulky turned, and the
winding continued. When the end of the wire is reached, it is carefully
loosened from the post, and firmly fastened to the spool.</p>

</div>

<p>It is best to have a separate spool for each wire, especially
if they are of great length. The same contrivance may be used for
unreeling the wire. Attach a gentle horse to the sulky, fasten the
pole securely to the hames, and have a boy lead him slowly along the
fence line. Once in fifty yards stop the horse, grasp the handle,
move forward very slowly, and draw the wire straight and taut. If no
sulky plow is at hand, a light &#8220;double-ended&#8221; sled, shown
in <a href="#fig081">figure 81</a>, may be used. A man holds the
short pole extending from one end, steadying<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_54">Page&nbsp;54</a></span> and pushing a
little, while the other winds the reel. The sled is drawn forward
by the wire as it is wound on the reel. To unreel, attach a slow
horse to a chain or rope fastened to the opposite end of the sled.
A man must walk behind the horse and hold the pole to steady the
sled. Managed in this way, the removal of a barbed wire fence is not
at all the formidable operation that has been supposed; it can be
taken down and set up again, easily, safely, and quite rapidly. <a
href="#fig082">Figure 82</a> shows another form of home-made sled,
which is very useful for carrying rolls of wire for making a fence.
The roll is supported on a rod, which has round ends to fit into the
uprights, and which turns in the slots. When the wire is run out,
the end is fastened to the clevis on the centre beam, and a notched
stake, <a href="#fig083">figure 83</a>, being put under the wire, the
sled is drawn up to tighten the wire, which<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_55">Page&nbsp;55</a></span> is then stapled.
This sled is useful for many other purposes, and is large enough to
carry five rolls of the wire, so that by going back and forth, the
whole of the fence can be put up very quickly. It is drawn by one
horse, the draft chain being fastened to the front beam.</p>

<p>The useful wire-stretcher, <a href="#fig086">figure 86</a>,
consists of a mowing machine knife-guard, bolted to a stout stick;
one curved, as shown in the lower engraving, is preferable to a
straight one, as it will not turn in the hand. When using it, the wire
is held firmly in the slot, and may be easily stretched by applying
the stick as a lever. Another kind of a wire-stretcher may be made
of hard wood or of iron or steel bars. It consists of three pieces,
two arms and a splicer, fastened together in the manner shown in <a
href="#fig087">figure 87</a>, leaving a slot near one end to hold the
wire. The longer arm is made immovable upon the splice by means of two
or more heavy bolts, while the<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_57">Page&nbsp;57</a></span> shorter arm is pivoted by one
bolt. This allows the slot to be opened to receive the wire. The short
arm is sharpened so that it may be stuck into a post, or the side of a
building, if convenient. By placing this lever behind a post, one man
can stretch thoroughly a long string of wire. When one man is doing the
work alone, he can stretch the wire, fasten the lever back by means of
a stick driven into the ground before it, and then go back and drive
the staples. The short end of the lever should be about twelve inches
long, and the long arm three or four feet, or even longer.</p>

</div>

<p>The stretcher shown in <a href="#fig088">figure 88</a> is made of
hard tough wood or iron. The wire is passed through the slot, the barbs
preventing it from slipping. The arm at right angles to the lever is
used to measure the distance of the strands. When the lever is set
against the post, the arm rests on the strand below. By sliding it up
or down, the distance between the strands is regulated.</p>

<p><a href="#fig089">Figure 89</a> shows another stretcher, that can be
made by any blacksmith. The toothed cam holds the wire so that it will
not slip. A block and tackle are often found useful to draw the wires
with. The rolls of wire are paid out of a wagon body, and when the
wire is to be drawn up, the grip is put on at any point, the tackle is
attached, and one horse draws it as tight as it needs be.</p>

<p>A wire fence needs frequent drawing up or it sags and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">Page&nbsp;58</a></span>
becomes useless. The alternate contraction and expansion caused by
change of temperature soon stretch the wire, to say nothing of other
causes. The cheap and effective method employed by telegraph companies
is illustrated in <a href="#fig090">figure 90</a>. It consists of a
pair of grip tongs and a set of small tackle-blocks. The tongs may be
made by any blacksmith, and the blocks are sold at all hardware and
tool stores. An iron hook is used to couple the tongs to the block, and
as the wire is drawn up, the free end of the rope may be given a turn
around the same post, to hold it while the staple is tightened to hold
the wire.</p>

it will be a quarter inch from the flat part, as shown in <a

should be about a half inch from the bend at <em>d</em>. Smooth with a
file. To use it let <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, <a href="#fig093">figure

</div>

<p>One of the great perplexities about building wire fences on rolling
ground, is how to make the posts in the hollows remain firm, for the
pull of the wire in wet weather, or when the frost is coming out, lifts
them and causes the wire to sag, and they cease to be an effective
barrier. Posts should not be used in the lowest depressions,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">Page&nbsp;61</a></span>
but in their place at the lowest spots a heavy stone should be
partially sunk into the ground, about which a smooth fence wire has
been wrapped, as seen in <a href="#fig096">figure 96</a>. When the
fence is built, the fence wires are brought down to their place and the
wire about the stone is twisted first about the lower wire, then the
next, and so on to the top. This prevents the wire from raising, and
does away with all trouble of the posts being pulled out by the wires.
In fencing across small streams the same plan is successful.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 98.&#8212;Section Of Fence Completed.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A very cheap fence is made of two boards below and three strands
of barb wire. To make the fence pig-proof without the boards, five
strands of wire, three inches apart, would be required at the bottom.
Two common fencing boards will occupy the same space, when placed
three inches apart, and cost less. But for the upper part of the
fence, wire is much cheaper than boards. The most considerable item
in this greater economy is the saving of posts. The wire requires
a post every sixteen feet; hence half the posts are saved. A stout
stake,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">Page&nbsp;62</a></span>
driven midway between the posts, holds the center of the boards in
place. These stakes need extend only eighteen inches above ground.
Posts that have rotted off in the ground will be long enough for these
stakes. Some say that the posts can be set thirty feet apart, but
sixteen feet is better. The posts should be at least thirty inches
in the ground and well tamped. It is easy to stretch the wire. Its
durability depends upon the quality of the wire and posts, and the
proper setting of them. Nail on the two boards, three inches apart; the
first strand is six inches above the top board, the second strand is
twelve inches above the first, and the third sixteen inches above the
second. When banked up, as hereafter described, this fence will turn
all farm stock. An important point is the bracing of the end-posts. If
this be neglected or improperly done, the fence will be a failure. <a
href="#fig097">Figure 97</a> shows how the end-post should be braced.
It should be a large post and set at least three feet in the ground.
The short post which holds the lower end of the brace, should also be
well set. Wrap the wire around the end-post several times, and drive
staples to hold it on all sides. If the line of fence is more than
forty rods long, at least two posts at each end should be braced.
After the posts are set, and before attaching the boards or wire,
plow a deep furrow along each side, throwing the earth inward. This
makes a bank along the line, allowing the fence to be several inches
higher; and the furrow drains the water away<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_63">Page&nbsp;63</a></span> from the posts, and also restrains
an animal that may be tempted to jump the fence. A section of the
completed fence is shown in <a href="#fig098">figure 98</a>. Do not
hang pieces of tin, etc., upon the top strands of wire, as often
recommended, that the animals may see the fence, and be able to avoid
it, because it is never necessary.</p>

</div>

<p>A modification of this combined fence is shown in <a
href="#fig099">figure 99</a>. It is made of one rail along the top,
and three wires below. After setting the posts plow a furrow two feet
from the posts on each side, throwing the furrow slice towards the
fence, and forming up the ridge neatly with a spade; then stretch the
three wires, and nail a two by four scantling edgewise. To prevent an
unpleasant sagging of the rails, the posts should be eight feet apart,
and the rails sixteen feet long. For common fencing, good straight
poles will answer well.</p>

used for every alternate strand, thus greatly lessening the expense.
Third, by the use of strips and short stakes, the posts may be placed
sixteen feet apart, and the fence remain as perfect as if there were
posts every eight feet. Fourth, to make the<span class="pagenum"><a

href="#fig103">103</a>. A barb-wire is attached to the short arm of
the brackets, which are fastened to the posts in such a manner as to
stretch two wires on the same horizontal plane, and fifteen inches
apart. The material required for each panel of the fence shown in <a
href="#fig100">figure 100</a>, are: Two posts, three barb-wires, two
plain wires of No. 12 galvanized iron, two six-inch boards, sixteen
feet long, three stakes about three feet long, and sharpened at one
end, four strips, four feet long and one and one-half inch square. To
build the fence: Lay off the ground by setting small pegs eight feet
apart, then dig the holes, and set the posts at every fourth peg.
Drive the sharpened stakes into the ground at the three pegs between
the posts, so that the top of the stakes will be nineteen inches
above the ground. Nail the boards on the first stake near the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">Page&nbsp;65</a></span> ground, and
the second one three inches above the first. Then mark off the place
for each wire on the first post, fasten the bottom wire, and put up
as far as the first stretching post; then add the other wires, using
first a barb-wire, and then a smooth one. The wires should be fastened
to the posts with long staples. The strips are to go in the middle of
the eight foot spaces; they should not quite touch the ground; fasten
them to the boards with nails and to the wire with short staples. These
strips can be made of poles or saplings, and the stakes of short or
crooked pieces from the posts. To attach the man-proof part: If the
brackets are of wood, nail them to the posts, sawing off the horizontal
arm to fifteen inches from the top wire, as in <a href="#fig103">figure
103</a>; stretch the wire and fasten to the end. If the brackets are
of iron, <a href="#fig102">figure 102</a>, spike the horizontal arm
to the top of the post, then put up the barb-wire loose under the
oblique arm, and stretch it. Then spike the foot of the oblique<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">Page&nbsp;66</a></span> arm to the
post, and slip the wire into the angle, and close the bracket by
closing the arms on the wire. <a href="#fig102">Figure 102</a> shows

</div>
<h3>THE BEST HEDGE PLANTS.</h3>

<p>The first emigrants from England to the American shores brought
with them memories of green hedge-rows, like those which still adorn
the motherland. But they found the country whither they had come
covered with a dense growth of timber, which furnished abundant
material for fences. Hedges were almost unknown in this country until
after civilization had reached the treeless prairies. Then, the want
of fencing material turned attention to hedges, and they became so
popular that many miles of them were planted, not only in the prairie
region, but also in the more eastern States, where cheaper fencing
material was plenty. Now the invention of barbed wire supplies a
material so cheap and easily put in place, that hedges have ceased to
be regarded as economical for general farm purposes. But they have
by no means gone wholly out of use. As a boundary fence, especially
upon the roadside, there is much to be said in favor of the hedge.
Nothing gives a neighborhood such a finished rural aspect, as to
have the roads bordered by hedges. The grounds around the summer
cottages on the New Jersey coast, and other popular summer resorts,
are largely enclosed with hedges. For interior divisions, as they
cannot be removed, they are not to be commended. An orchard, the most
permanent of all the plantations upon the farm, may be appropriately
enclosed by a live fence. Hedges are either protective barriers,
really live fences, or merely ornamental. In properly regulated
communities, where cattle are not allowed<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_68">Page&nbsp;68</a></span> to run at large, the roadside
hedge may be ornamental, while one around an orchard should be able
to keep out animals and other intruders. After many experiments and
failures, the Osage Orange (<cite>Maclura aurantiaca</cite>), has been
found to make the best hedges. Being a native of Arkansas, it has been
found to be hardy much farther North, and may be regarded as the most
useful hedge plant in all localities where the winter is not severe.
Where the Osage Orange is not hardy, Buckthorn, Japan Quince and Honey
Locust are the best substitutes. Honey Locust is a most useful hedge
plant, as it is readily raised from seed, grows rapidly, bears cutting
well, and in a few years will make a barrier that will turn the most
violent animal.</p>

<p>The first requisite for a hedge of any kind is to secure thrifty
plants of uniform size. Osage Orange plants are raised from seeds by
nurserymen, and when of the right size, should be taken up in autumn
and &#8220;heeled in.&#8221; The ground, which it is proposed to
occupy by the hedge, should be broken up in autumn and then replowed
in spring, unless it is a raw prairie sod, which should be broken
a year before the hedge is planted. It is a very usual, but very
bad practice, to plow a ridge with a back-furrow, as shown in <a
href="#fig106">figure 106</a>. This leaves an unplowed strip of hard
soil directly under the line upon which the hedge is to stand. When
harrowed, it appears very fair on the surface, but it is useless to
expect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">Page&nbsp;69</a></span>
young plants to thrive on such a bed of hard soil, and its result will
be as seen in <a href="#fig107">figure 107</a>. The first growth is
feeble, irregular, and many vacant spots appear. The land should be
plowed as in <a href="#fig108">figure 108</a>. When the sod is rotted,
the land should be harrowed lengthwise of the furrows, and the dead
furrow left in the first plowing closed by twice turning back the
ridge. There is then a deep, mellow, well-drained bed for the plants
in which the roots have room to grow and gather ample nutrition.
<a href="#fig109">Figure 109</a> shows the effect of this kind of
cultivation. As a barrier against stock, or a windbreak, it is best to
plant in double rows, each row being set opposite the spaces in the
other, thus:</p>

      *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
   </p>
</div>

<p>It is highly desirable that the hedge should be in true,
uniform rows, either straight or in regular curves. This can be
done only by setting closely to a line. Osage Orange plants may
be raised from seed, but as this is a<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_70">Page&nbsp;70</a></span> difficult operation, it is
usually best to buy young plants from a reliable nurseryman. They
are best cut down to about six inches high, and the roots partially
trimmed. It is an advantage to &#8220;puddle&#8221; the roots, which
is done by dipping them in a mixture composed of one-half earth and
half fresh manure from the cow stable, wet to the consistency of a
thin paste. There are various methods of setting the plants. Some use
a trowel with a blade about ten inches long; others a dibble, and a
larger number than either of the others, a spade. For setting long
lines, in situations where appearances are of secondary importance,
young Osage plants are set very rapidly by running a furrow where the
rows are to stand, laying the plants with their roots spread on the
mellow soil, one side of the furrow. A furrow is next turned upon the
roots, and the plants which may have been disarranged are restored
by hand. A tread of the foot will consolidate the earth around each
plant. Unless the subsoil is naturally very porous, the ground must be
thoroughly underdrained. A line of tiles should be laid six or eight
feet from the line of the hedge. The ground for four or five feet on
either side of the hedge, should be kept thoroughly cultivated the
first three or four years after planting. This cultivation is to be
done early each season and cease the first of July, to give the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">Page&nbsp;71</a></span> new wood a
chance to ripen. The plants should be permitted to grow the first year
undisturbed. The following spring, the hedge should be cut off close
to the ground with a scythe or mowing machine, and all vacancies where
plants have died out or been thrown out by frost, should be filled. The
ground on both sides of the ridge is to be kept well cultivated. <a
href="#fig110">Figure 110</a> shows the difference in root growth in
cultivated and uncultivated ground.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 110.&#8212;Effect Of Cultivation.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A thick growth of young shoots will appear, and these are to be cut
back to four inches high, the middle of summer and again in September.
The object is to obtain a dense growth close to the ground. The third
year the pruning is to be repeated, only the shoots must be left four
to six inches above the last previous cutting. The lateral shoots which
are near the ground, are to be left undisturbed. The trimming should be
such as to leave the hedge broad at the base, with a regular slope to
the summit like a double-span roof.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig111">
   <img src="images/fig111.png" width="398" height="173"
        alt="hedge plants bent to the left" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 111.&#8212;Hedge &#8220;Plashed.&#8221;</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another method is to permit the hedge to grow untrimmed for four or
five years. It is then plashed, or laid over sidewise. This is done by
cutting the plants about half through on one side with a sharp axe,
and bending them over as shown in <a href="#fig111">figure 111</a>.
The hedge is first headed back and trimmed up to reduce the top. In
a short time new shoots will spring from the stubs and stems, making
a dense growth of interlacing stems and<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_72">Page&nbsp;72</a></span> branches. Another method of laying
a hedge, is to dig away a few inches of earth on one side of each plant
to loosen the roots, then lay the plant over to the desired angle and
fasten it there. The earth is then replaced around the roots, and tread
down firmly. We believe that a patent is claimed for this process, but
its validity is seriously questioned.</p>

<p>It is essential that hedges, whether planted for ornament or
utility, shall be kept in shape by trimming every year. It is less
labor to trim a hedge three times during the year, when the branches
are small and soft, than once when the branches have made a full
season&#8217;s growth. If the hedge is trimmed once in June and again
in August, it will be kept in good shape, and the labor will be less
than if the trimming was put off until spring. In August the branches
can be cut with shears or a sharp corn knife. The foliage on them
will aid in their burning, when they have dried a few days in the
sun. The thorns are not so hard as in the spring. The brush will be
less, and on account of their pliability and greater weight, will pack
into the heap much better. If trimmed in August, the hedge will not
make any considerable growth during the fall. August trimming does
not injure the hedge, rather helps it, as it tends to ripen the wood,
preventing a late Autumn growth to be injured by the winter. The loss
of sap is less than when the trimming is done in the early spring, as
then the wounds are larger, and do not heal before the sap flows. Do
not neglect to burn the brush as soon as it has dried sufficiently.
If allowed to remain on the ground, it will harbor mice and other
vermin. Trim the hedge in August and burn the brush. The trimming
should be done in such a manner as to expose the greater amount of
foliage to the direct action of the light, air, rain and dew. This is
attained by keeping the sides at every trimming in the form of sloping
walls from the broad base to the summit<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_73">Page&nbsp;73</a></span> like a double-span roof. They are
sometimes trimmed with vertical sides and broad, flat top, but this is
not a favorable plan for permanency. The lower leaves and stems die
out, leaving an unsightly open bottom of naked stems, with a broad roof
of foliage above. Such trimming and its results have done much to bring
hedges into disrepute.</p>

   <h3>HEDGES FOR THE SOUTH.</h3>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 112.&#8212;Cactus Hedge.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Osage Orange is a native of the Southwestern States, and
flourishes on good soil anywhere in the South. Yet there are certain
succulent plants which grow so rapidly in the South, and require so
little care, that they are very successfully employed for hedges in
the Gulf States. One of these is the <cite>Yucca gloriosa</cite>, or
Spanish Bayonet. Its natural habit of growth is to produce a dense mass
of leaves on a long stem. But by cutting back the growth of the stiff,
armed leaves is produced low down, and a hedge of this soon becomes
an impassable barrier. Large panicles of beautiful white blossoms are
produced at the summit, making such a hedge very ornamental during
the flowering season. Various species of cactus are also employed in
the Southwest for hedges. In some of the Middle-Western States may be
seen a hedge like <a href="#fig112">figure 112</a>. At some distance
from the highway, a field had been enclosed with the tree cactus,
which there grows only from four to ten feet<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_74">Page&nbsp;74</a></span> high. The plants that were in the
line of the fence were left growing, and those cleared from the field
were woven into a formidable barrier to anything larger than a rabbit.
While no two rods in this fence are alike, its general appearance is
like that shown in the engraving.</p>

   <h3>ORNAMENTAL HEDGES AND SCREENS.</h3>

</div>

<p>Hedges and screens for ornamental purposes alone, do not come
strictly within the scope of this work, but we will briefly mention a
few desirable plants for the purpose. The Japan Quince, <cite>Cydonia
Japonica</cite>, of which <a href="#fig113">figures 113</a> and <a
href="#fig114">114</a> show a branch, flower and fruit, is one of
the best deciduous plants for an ornamental hedge. It will grow in
almost any soil; if left to itself it forms a dense, strong bush,
but it may be clipped or trained into any desired form. Its leaves
are of dark glossy green, they come early in spring and remain
until late in Autumn. This is one of the earliest shrubs to<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">Page&nbsp;75</a></span> bloom in
spring; its flowers are generally intense scarlet, though there are
varieties with white, rose-colored, or salmon-colored flowers. A hedge
of this plant is not only highly ornamental, but its abundant thorns
make a good barrier. Privet, <cite>Ligustrum vulgare</cite>, makes
a very neat screen, but will not bear severe cutting back, and is
therefore suitable only for grounds of sufficient extent to admit of
its being allowed to make unrestrained growth. The common Barberry,
<cite>Berberis vulgaris</cite>, also makes an exceedingly pretty screen
in time, but it is of slow growth. The Buffalo Berry, <cite>Sheperdia
argentea</cite>, has been tried for hedges, but for some reason
it has never attained any popularity. In the Southern States, the
Cherokee Rose has been found quite successful for the purpose, and
nothing in the shape of a hedge can exceed, in striking effect, one
of these in full bloom. For evergreen screens nothing is better than
the Hemlock, <cite>Tsuga Canadensis</cite>. The Norway Spruce is of
rapid growth and bears cutting well. The Arbor Vit&aelig;, <cite>Thuja
occidentalis</cite>, is also very successfully employed for the
purpose.</p>

      <p>Fig. 116.&#8212;&#8220;Horses&#8221; For Making The Fence.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p><a href="#fig118">Figure 118</a> shows a very strong and secure
board fence, composed entirely of ordinary fence boards. The triangular
frames, which serve as posts, are each of two pieces of inch boards,
crossed and braced as shown in <a href="#fig115">figure 115</a>. The
panels, <a href="#fig117">figure 117</a>, are sixteen feet long, each
composed of four boards, six inches wide. The space between<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">Page&nbsp;76</a></span> the lower
two boards is two and a half inches, second space three and a half
inches. A convenient way of making the panels is to use three horses,
like that shown in <a href="#fig116">figure 116</a>, the length of
each being equal to the total width of the panel, and the three short
upright strips marking the respective spaces between the boards. The
top is covered with iron to clinch the nails used in putting the
panel together. The boards are laid on these horses, and the upright
cross-pieces nailed on. The second board from the top of each panel is
notched at both ends, as shown in <a href="#fig117">figure 117</a>. A
good way to make the triangular frames alike, is to cut the pieces by
a uniform pattern. Then make one frame of the size and form desired,
and at each of the three places where they are nailed together, fasten
a plate of iron, thick enough to prevent the penetration of a common
wrought nail driven against it. Now lay this pattern frame on the floor
with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">Page&nbsp;77</a></span> the
iron bolts uppermost.</p>

   </div>
</div>

<p class="continued">Then lay three pieces on this in exactly the right
position, drive wrought nails through the two pieces and against the
iron plates, which will clinch the nails firmly as fast as they are
driven. This will enable the man to nail the frames together quite
rapidly. In setting up the fence, each triangular frame supports the
ends of two panels. The upper and lower boards of each panel interlock
with the frame, as shown in <a href="#fig118">figure 118</a>, making
a very strong fence. On open prairie or other wind-swept situations,
it may be necessary to stake down some of the frames, to prevent
their blowing over. This is quickly done by sharpening pieces of inch
boards, twelve inches long, and one inch wide, and driving one beside
the foot of the triangle, where it rests on the ground, and putting an
eight-penny nail through both.</p>

<p><a href="#fig119">Figures 119</a> and <a href="#fig120">120</a>

extent in the territories. The<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_78">Page&nbsp;78</a></span> base of each is the half of
a small log, split through the center. For the fence shown in <a
href="#fig119">figure 119</a>, two augur holes are bored a few
inches apart, and small poles driven to serve as posts. Rails or
round poles of the usual length are laid to the desired height, and
the top of the posts tied together with wire. In situations where
timber is less plentiful, a single stake is set into the base, as in
<a href="#fig120">figure 120</a>, braced, and barbed or plain wire
attached by staples. Besides the advantage of being easily moved, these
fences can be prepared in winter, when there is little else to do, and
rapidly set in place at any time when the ground is clear of snow.</p>

wood, an inch or more in diameter, will answer. The size of this rod
and its strength will depend upon the amount of zigzag that is given
to the lengths. If the corners are one foot on each side of a central
line, the fence firmly held together by the rods, will in effect
stand on a two feet wide base. Less than this would perhaps sometimes
answer, and there are no sharp corners, or deep recesses for weeds and
rubbish.</p>

<p>A fence that can be easily moved and quickly set up is shown in
<a href="#fig122">figure 122</a>. It consists of panels made of
strips<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">Page&nbsp;80</a></span>
eight or ten feet long, nailed to two by four posts, which are beveled
to a sharp corner at the lower end. These panels are supported by
posts, placed as shown in the engraving, and pinned to the fence posts
by wooden pins, driven in by a light mallet. The panels are light and
can be loaded upon a wagon from which the sides and ends of the box are
removed. A box of pins and the mallet are all the tools required to set
up the fence. This fence is not easily overthrown by the wind, which
holds it down firmly when blowing on the face of it. For this reason in
windy localities, the fence should be set facing the windy quarter.</p>

securely nailed on very light posts or on the edge of narrow boards

becoming covered with drifted snow. It is equally convenient on the

<p>It is often very convenient when poultry are inclosed during
the growing season, to have a fence for the henyard which can
be readily moved from place to place. The illustration, <a
href="#fig124">figure 124</a>, shows one of these. Cut the posts the
same length as the pickets, and to the inner<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_81">Page&nbsp;81</a></span> side of each attach two strong
iron hoops bent into a semi-circle, one near the bottom and the other
half way up. Through these hoops drive stakes fitted to fill them
closely, with sharpened points for easily entering the ground. When
removing the fence the posts can be slipped off.</p>

<p>Turkeys, even when they have attained a considerable size, should
be shut up until after the dew is off the grass, and other fowls must
be confined in limited runs, while the young are small. It is quite
an advantage if these runs can be changed easily, and this can be
accomplished only when they are enclosed in a light movable<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">Page&nbsp;82</a></span> fence. Such a
fence is shown in <a href="#fig125">figure 125</a>, on preceding page.
It is made in twelve or sixteen feet sections by nailing laths to light
pieces of the proper length. The upper end of the laths is sharpened;
the end ones are of double thickness. The sections are placed with
the end-laths intercrossing at the top, and about six inches apart at
the bottom, as in cross-section, <a href="#fig126">figure 126</a>.
They are held apart by blocks, <a href="#fig127">figure 127</a>,
which rest on the upper edges of the cross-pieces and against the
laths. They are held together, and to the ground, by stakes driven
against the outer side of the end laths. As these stakes have the
same angle as the laths, they hold the sections together, and also
the fence in its place and down to the ground. The triangular space
where the sections join is closed by a lath driven in the ground or
tacked to the block between the cross-pieces. Corners must be formed
of two sections inclined inward, and in the same way that sections are
joined. The stakes are readily withdrawn,<span class="pagenum"><a

they are easily handled.</p>

that of the other form, is provided with small wheels, which run on a

at the lower end, and driven into the ground, then fastening to them
with suitable staples strips of rather broad hoop-iron at the top, with

</div>

<p>In a situation where a line of fence crosses a stream or a gully
liable to be flooded, it is necessary to make special provision for
it. A fence extending down near the surface and sufficiently rigid
to withstand the current, would arrest the driftwood and other
objects floated down on the flood, and soon become a dam. The right
kind of a fence must therefore yield to the force of the flood, and
renew its position, or be easily replaced<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_86">Page&nbsp;86</a></span> after it has subsided. <a
href="#fig133">Figure 133</a> is a very effectual flood-gate for a
running stream. The posts, <em>B</em>, <em>B</em>, are firmly set on
the bank, and a stick of timber, <em>A</em>, mortised on the top of
them. The three uprights, <em>C</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>C</em>, are
hinged to the cross-timber, and the boards, <em>F</em>, fastened in
place by ten-penny steel fence nails. The gate easily swings with
the current, <em>D</em>. <a href="#fig134">Figure 134</a> shows a
form which operates in a similar manner like the other. It consists
of two stout posts, five feet high, bearing a heavy cross-bar,
rounded at each end, and fitted into<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_87">Page&nbsp;87</a></span> sockets, in which the bar with
gate attached can swing. The construction of the gate is easily seen
from the engraving.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig135">
   <img src="images/fig135.png" width="500" height="312" alt="floating fence" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 135.&#8212;Fence For A Forest Stream.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The above forms are self-acting, and swing back to their places as
the water subsides. For larger streams, it is necessary to construct
fences that give way before the flood, and can be brought into position
again when it is over. One of these, for a stream which is liable
to bring down much driftwood, is shown in <a href="#fig135">figure
135</a>. The logs are the trunks of straight trees, about eighteen
inches in diameter, which are hewed on two sides; posts are mortised in
each of these logs, and on them planks are firmly nailed. The logs are
then linked together with inch iron rods, and the first one connected
by means of a long link to a tree or post firmly set in the ground upon
the banks of the stream. The links must all work freely. When high
water occurs, the fence is washed around and left on the bank; after
the water has subsided sufficiently, the logs may be dragged back to
their places, as shown in the engraving, by means of a horse,<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">Page&nbsp;88</a></span> hitched to a
staple in the end of the log. <a href="#fig136">Figure 136</a> shows a
lighter fence made of poles or rails, held by interlinking staples to
the posts on the side of the stream. As the floods come down, the rails
are washed from the center, and float freely at either side of the
stream. They can be laid up in place again when the water subsides.</p>

</div>

<p>The fence shown in <a href="#fig137">figure 137</a>, though rather
rude and primitive, has the advantage of being cheaply constructed and
permanent. Two strong posts are driven into the banks on the margin of
the stream, to which a log, a foot or more in diameter, is fastened by
pins, spikes or withes, about twenty inches above low water mark. Then
fence rails are sharpened at one end, driven into the stream above the
log, upon which the other ends rest, projecting about a foot. They are
then securely spiked or pinned to the log, and the work is done. The
pointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">Page&nbsp;89</a></span>
ends of the rails are up the stream, and in case of flood, the water
pours over the obstruction, carrying with it brush, driftwood, etc.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig138">
   <img src="images/fig138.png" width="500" height="454"
        alt="automatic flood gate" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 138.&#8212;Automatic Flood-gate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The flood-gate, <a href="#fig138">figure 138</a>, is designed to
prevent small stock from passing from one field to another through a
water-course under a fence where there is low water, while in time of
high water the gate will rise sufficiently to allow the floating trash
to pass through, but not higher, as it is self-fastening. The invention
consists of a gate constructed of perpendicular slats hinged above,
and moving. This hangs across a stream or ditch. On the down-stream
side of the gate a swing paddle is fixed, which hangs in the water.
This, marked <em>a</em> in the illustration, is attached to an angular
bar, <em>b</em>, which is moved when the flow of water presses with
force against the paddle. Two notched pieces, <em>c c</em>, attached
to the gate, rest upon the angular bar, <em>b</em>, at low water; when
both the paddle and the gate hang at rest, perpendicularly, these
notched pieces, <em>c c</em>, hold the gate firmly shut; when, however,
the water rises and the paddle is moved<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_90">Page&nbsp;90</a></span> sufficiently to disengage the
notches, the gate will be moved by the force of the water, and if
sticks or rubbish of any kind float down against it they will be swept
under it by the water. When the water subsides, the paddle swings back,
the pieces, <em>c c</em>, catch and keep the gate closed at any height
it may fall to. Let the cross-piece, <em>d</em>, that is halved into
the posts, be about one foot above the banks of the ditch. The pieces,
<em>f f f f</em>, represent the fence above the ditch, the small posts,
<em>g g</em>, with the pieces nailed to them, are to prevent the stock
from passing when the gate is partly closed, at the same time bracing
the posts, <em>e e</em>; the holes at <em>h</em> are to raise and lower
the paddle <em>a</em>; if small, a cleat on one of the arms upon which
the piece <em>B</em> is hung, prevents the paddle from swinging towards
the gate.</p>

<p><a href="#fig139">Figure 139</a> shows a kind of fence used
in Missouri to put across sloughs. It is in effect two panels

with the tops about one foot above ground; the other posts, to
which the planks are nailed, are bolted<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_91">Page&nbsp;91</a></span> to the top of the inserted posts.
The ends of the panel that connect with the post on the bank are
slightly nailed with cross-strips near the top, so as to be easily
broken loose when the flood comes. There are also temporary braces
bearing upstream, put in to prevent the fence from falling, but are
easily washed out, when the fence falls down stream, and logs and other
obstructions pass by readily. As soon as the flood goes down, the fence
is easily raised, a panel at a time, to a proper place.</p>

<p><a href="#fig140">Figure 140</a> shows a cheap and effective form
of flood fence. The material used are square-hewn timbers, seven or
eight inches for sills, stone pillars, split rails about ten feet long.
The rails are driven in the ground about two feet deep; the upper ends
project above the sill two or three feet, and are spiked down to the
sill with large spikes; when the freshet comes, logs and driftwood are
carried over, and the fence will be left in as good order as before the
high water.</p>

<p><a href="#fig141">Figure 141</a> represents a gulch fence or
gate which is in common use in some parts of the Pacific Slope. It
is particularly adapted to the gulches of the foot hills and the
irrigating ditches of the plains. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_92">Page&nbsp;92</a></span> gate swings freely by the upper
pole, the ends of which rest in large holes in posts on either bank, or
in the cross of stakes. The upright pieces may be of split pickets or
sawed lumber, as may be the most convenient. If the stream is likely
to carry floating brush, logs, etc., the slats should be of heavier
material than is necessary when this is not the case. When constructed
properly the gate will give, allowing rubbish and freshets to pass, and
then resume its proper position. The principal advantage claimed for
this gate is that it is not apt to gather the passing debris.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 142.&#8212;Fence For A Dry Gully.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A gully is sometimes difficult to fence properly, but by hanging
a frame over it, as is seen in <a href="#fig142">figure 142</a>, the
object may be quickly accomplished. The frame can be spiked together in
a short time, or framed together if a more elaborate one is desired. To
make it serve its purpose completely, the rails must be closer together
near the bottom than at the top of the frame, in order to prevent small
animals from going through it.</p>

<p>A modification of this last named device, seen at <a
href="#fig143">figure 143</a>, gives greater space for the passage of
brushwood or other large objects, which may be swept down on the flood.
The width, strength and size of the bases supporting the side posts,
and of the braces, will depend upon the width and depth of the channel.
The base<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">Page&nbsp;93</a></span>
pieces can be firmly anchored by stakes driven slanting over the ends
and outsides, or by stones piled on. For wide, shallow streams, three
or even more braced uprights can be anchored eight or ten feet apart in
the bed with heavy stones, with two or more swinging sections. If small
trees or long timbers are likely to float down, the swinging gate may
be twelve or fifteen feet wide. For smaller streams, with strong high
banks, five or six feet will suffice.</p>

   <h3>WATERING PLACE IN A CREEK.</h3>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 145.&#8212;A Clean Watering Place.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Cattle naturally select a certain place in a water-course to drink
at, where the bank is not precipitous. During a good part of the year
this bank is muddy, on account of its moisture and trampling of the
animals. As a result, the horses get the scratches, the cows come to
the milking pen with muddy udders, and frequently animals are injured
by the crowding in the mud. Hogs are often seriously injured, because
the mud becomes so deep and tough, that they are well nigh helpless in
it. Another objection is that the animals wade to the middle of the
creek, and soon make its bottom as muddy as the bank, and the water
becomes unfit for drinking. The arrangement shown in our illustration,
which may be built of heavy plank, brick, or flat stones, prevents all
this. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">Page&nbsp;95</a></span>
is constructed by first making an incline to a level platform for the
animals to stand on while drinking. This plane terminates in an abrupt
descent, forming a trough for the water to flow through. The trough
should not be more than two feet wide, that the animals may easily get
across it. The level floor permits the animals to drink at their ease,
often a matter of importance. Such a drinking place should be made at
the upper end of the creek, where it passes through a field to prevent
the animals from soiling the water by standing in it above where they
drink.</p>

<h3>MAKING FENCE POSTS.</h3>

        alt="split marking on end of log" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 147.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is quite an art in splitting logs into posts. Every post
should have some heart wood, which lasts the longer, for two reasons:
That there may be durable wood into which to drive the nails, and
without it some of the posts, composed entirely of sap-wood, will rot
off long before others, making the most annoying of all repairing
necessary. If the log is of a size to make twelve posts, split along
the lines of <a href="#fig146">figure 146</a>, which will give each
post a share of heart wood. This will make a cross section of the
posts triangular, the curved base being somewhat more than half of
either side. This is a fairly well shaped post, and much better
than a square one having little or no heart wood. Although the log
may be large enough to make sixteen or eighteen posts, it is better
to split it the same way. It should first be cut into halves, then
quarters, then twelfths. If it is attempted<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_96">Page&nbsp;96</a></span> to split one post off the side
of a half, the wood will &#8220;draw out,&#8221; making the post
larger at one end than the other&#8212;not a good shape, for there
will be little heart wood at the small end. When the log is too large
to admit of it being split in that way, each post may nevertheless
be given enough heart wood by splitting along the lines, shown in <a
href="#fig147">figure 147</a>. First cut the logs into halves, then
quarters, then eighths. Then split off the edge of each eighth, enough
for a post&#8212;about one-fourth only of the wood, as it is all heart
wood, and then halve the balance. A good post can be taken off the
edge, and yet enough heart wood for the remaining two posts remain.</p>

<p>A simple arrangement for holding a post while it is being bored or

the ground, and two shorter sticks resting<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_97">Page&nbsp;97</a></span> upon them at right angles. The
upper pieces have saddles cut out for the posts to fit into. A staple
with a large iron hook or &#8220;dog,&#8221; is fastened into one end
of each cross-piece, as shown in the engraving. When the post is laid
in position, the hooks are driven into it holding it firmly.</p>

An easy method of driving is shown in <a href="#fig149">figure 149</a>.
A wagon is loaded with posts and furnished with a stage in the rear
end of the box, upon which a person can stand to give the posts the
first start. Another man holds the posts upright while they are<span

one post is driven to its place, the wagon is moved to the next place,
and this operation repeated.</p>

<p>To drive posts, a wooden maul should be used. This is made of a
section of an elm trunk or branch, eight or nine inches in diameter,
<a href="#fig150">figure 150</a>. An iron ring is driven on each end,
and wedged all around, the wood at the edge being beaten down over the
rings with a hammer or the poll of an axe. To prevent the posts from
splitting or being battered too much, the ends of the maul should be
hollowed a little, and never rounded out, and the ends of the posts
should be beveled all around. The hole in the maul for the handle
should be made larger on one side, and lengthwise of the maul, and the
handle spread by two wedges driven in such a way as not to split the
maul.</p>

      <p>Fig. 154.&#8212;Scantling With Handle In Position.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Posts are very liable to split in driving, unless some precaution
is used. This damage and loss can be avoided in a great measure
by proper preparation of the posts before they are driven. The
tops of sawed posts should have the sides cut off, as in <a
href="#fig151">figure 151</a>, or simply cut off each corner, as in
<a href="#fig151">figure 153</a>, while a round post should be shaped
as in <a href="#fig151">figure 152</a>. The part of the post removed
need not be more than half an inch in thickness, but when the corners
only are cut away, the chip should be thicker. In driving, it is very
important to strike the post squarely on the top, and not at one corner
or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">Page&nbsp;99</a></span>
side. In most soils at the North, the frosts heave posts more or less
each season, and they need to be driven down to the usual depth.
To do this with little injury to the post, the device shown in <a
href="#fig154">figure 154</a> may be used. It is a piece of tough hard
wood scantling, <em>e</em>, eighteen inches in length, with tapering
ends. It is provided with a handle, <em>h</em>, three feet in length,
of quite small size, and if possible, of green timber. In using it,
let one person (a boy will do) lay the bit of scantling on top of the
post to be re-driven, when, with the beetle or sledge, the scantling,
instead of the post is struck, thus preventing the splitting of the
post. When the top of a fence is surmounted by a stringer, as in
the engraving, the effect of the blow is distributed over a large
space,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">Page&nbsp;100</a></span>
and both stringer and post escape injury. The attendant should keep
hold of the handle, <em>h</em>, while the posts are being driven, and
move the scantling from post to post as required.</p>

<p>For a farmer who has a large number of posts to set, a special
apparatus for driving them will be found useful. The accompanying
illustrations show a machine of this kind. An axle, <em>a</em>, <a
href="#fig155">figure 155</a>, of hard wood, eight and one-half feet
long; a hickory sapling will do. It has spindles shaved to fit the hind
wheels of a wagon, which are fastened by linch-pins, leaving about six
feet space between the hubs. A coupling-pole, <em>b</em>, thirteen feet
long,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">Page&nbsp;101</a></span>
is framed in and strongly braced at right angles with the axle,
and connects in front with the forward axle of a common wagon. The
main sill, <em>d</em>, <a href="#fig156">figure 156</a>, is one
stick of timber, six by eight inches, by fourteen feet long and
has a cross-piece, <em>e</em>, framed in the end. Two side-pieces,
<em>f</em>, two by four inches by five feet long, are pinned or
bolted to the main sill at <em>g</em>, and cross-pieces framed into
them, as shown in <a href="#fig156">figure 156</a>, so framed that
the lower edges of the side-pieces will be two inches from the axle,
when the main sill rests on the axle. The side-pieces, <em>f</em>,
should be twenty-two inches apart at the ends. The front end of the
main sill rests on the front axle, in place of a bolster, and the
&#8220;king-bolt&#8221; passes through it at <em>h</em>; the upright
guides, <em>i</em>, are two by four inches by fourteen feet long,
bolted to the side-pieces, <em>f</em>, with a space of fourteen
inches between; a cap, <em>j</em>, two by three by twenty-six inches
long, is framed on top. Two braces, <em>k</em>, two by four inches by
sixteen feet long, are bolted to the upright guides, two feet below
the cap, and connect at the bottom with a cross-piece, <em>l</em>,
two by eight by twenty-two inches long, between the braces. It has
rounded ends passing through two-inch holes in the braces, and
fastened by a pin outside, to form a loose joint. This cross-piece,
<em>l</em>, is held down on the main sill by a strip, <em>m</em>,

is held in place by a short pin. By moving this cross-piece, the
upright guides, <em>i</em>, are kept perpendicular when going up or
down hill. A small windlass, <em>o</em>, <a href="#fig155">figure 155</a>, is placed under
the axle, <em>a</em>, between hangers framed into the axle, close
to the hubs. Two brace-ropes, or wires, <em>p</em>, are fastened to
this windlass at the extreme ends, and wound around it a turn or two
in opposite directions, drawn tight and fastened to the main braces
near the top. By turning the windlass, <em>o</em>, slightly, by means

hook fastened in the maul, is pressed into place by a small hickory
spring, <em>y</em>, acting on a small iron pin, <em>z</em>; when it

convenience. The rope passes from the windlass over the pulley at the
top, down and under the pulley, <em>v</em>, then up, and is fastened at
7, on the cap, <em>j</em>, wire braces at 8. By releasing the cranks
and ratchet, the follower will run down the guides, and, striking the
maul, will &#8220;click&#8221; the latch into place, ready for another
hoist. For two men it is easy work, and can be handled quite rapidly.
Drive astride the proposed line of fence; lay a measuring-pole on the
ground to mark the spot for the next post; drive forward with the post
driver, having the maul partly raised, set up a post, and proceed to
drive it.</p>

   <h3>SETTING A GATE POST.</h3>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 158.&#8212;A Gate Post Set In Cement.</p></div>
</div>

<p>No matter how strong or how well braced a gate may be, it
will soon begin to sag and catch on the ground, if the gate post
is not firmly planted. Sometimes, owing to the soft nature of
the ground, it is almost impossible<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_104">Page&nbsp;104</a></span> to plant the post firmly,
but in such cases the work can generally be done satisfactorily by
packing medium-sized stones around the post, in the hole, as shown
in <a href="#fig158">figure 158</a>. If it is thought that this will
not insure sufficient firmness, add good cement. Place in a layer of
stones, then cement enough to imbed the next layer of stones, and so
on, until the hole is full and the post planted. Do not cover up the
stones with earth or disturb the post for a few days, until the cement
has &#8220;set.&#8221; Remember that the post must be set plumb while
the work is going on, as it can never be straightened after the cement
has &#8220;set.&#8221; Only durable posts should be used, and this
method of setting should only be followed with gate posts which are
supposed to be permanent, and not with posts liable to be changed.</p>

</div>

<p>A still better method is shown in <a href="#fig159">figure 159</a>.
Before the post is set into the hole, a flat stone is laid edgewise in
the bottom, on the side which is to receive the greatest pressure from
the foot of the post. When the post is set, and the hole half filled
with earth, a second stone is placed against the post on the side to
which it will be drawn by the weight of the gate. The stones receive
the pressure and hold the post firmly in position.</p>

      <p>Fig. 160.&#8212;Different Methods Of Treating Posts.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Low meadow and other marsh land is subject to heaving by the frost,
and much difficulty is experienced in securing firm fences upon such
ground, as the posts are drawn up by the freezing of the surface. To
avoid this, much may be done in the way of selecting posts that are
larger at one end than the other. It will help very much to put a
strong, durable pin through the bottom end of the post, or to notch
it at each side, as in <a href="#fig160">figure 160</a>, and to brace
the bottom with a flat stone, driven well into the side of the hole
with the rammer. When the soil is very soft and mucky, it is best to
drive the posts and to make them hold well in the ground, to spike
wedge-shaped pieces to them on either side, by which they are held
firmly in their places.</p>

<p>A living tree which stands in the right place, makes a very durable
and substantial fence-post. In the great<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_106">Page&nbsp;106</a></span> treeless regions of the
Mississippi Valley, where it is difficult to obtain timber for posts,
it is not an unusual practice to plant trees for the purpose on street
boundaries, and other places where the fence is to be permanent. White
willow is well adapted for the purpose on suitable soils, as it grows
rapidly and bears close pruning. In situations where the soil is even
moderately damp, white willow posts, four inches in diameter, cut
green and set in spring, will take root and grow. The new branches
soon form a bushy head, which may be cut back from time to time. It is
not advisable to nail boards or drive staples directly into the tree.
With a board fence, the swaying of the tree loosens the nails, and if
barbed wire is stapled to the tree, the bark and wood will in time grow
over them as in <a href="#fig161">figure 161</a>. To obviate this, a
stick is nailed to the tree as in <a href="#fig161">figure 162</a>,
and to this the fence is attached. A still better method is to secure
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">Page&nbsp;107</a></span>
strip of wood to the tree by two or three pairs of interlocking
staples.</p>

</div>

<p>Fence posts split from a variety of causes, and when they are in
this condition they make a very insecure fence. The usual way is to
merely nail an old horseshoe or two across the split part, just below
the holes in the posts. This answers fairly well, but does not draw
the cleft together, and horseshoes are not always on hand. A better
method of doing this is shown in <a href="#fig163">figure 163</a>.
A short, stout chain is put around the top of the post, just tight
enough to admit of a strong lever. The parts of the posts are then
brought together by a heavy downward pressure of the lever and held
there, while a strip of good tin, such as can be cut from the bodies
of tin cans, is put around and securely nailed. If the post<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">Page&nbsp;108</a></span> is a heavy
one and the cleft large, it is well to take the entire body of a can
and double it, to give it additional strength before nailing it on. The
dotted lines show where the tin is nailed.</p>

<p><a href="#fig164">Figure 164</a> shows a modified cant-hook for
drawing together the upper extremities of fence stakes that are to be
wired, as in the engraving. The half-moon shaped iron, <em>a</em>, is
riveted fast to the top end of the lever, and is to prevent the end of
the lever from slipping off the stake when in use. The second iron from
the top, <em>b</em>, is twenty-five inches long, with two hooks at the
end, though one will do; this is to catch the stake on the opposite
side of the fence. This iron is fastened in the lever by a bolt in
a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">Page&nbsp;109</a></span> long
mortise, in the same way, as the hook in an ordinary cant-hook. The
iron rod, <em>c</em>, has a hole in one end, and is drawn out to a
point at the other&#8212;this is fastened to the lever by a bolt in a
long mortise, and serves to catch in the stake or rail, and hold the
stakes together, while the man adjusts the iron around the stakes. When
the stakes are drawn tightly to the fence, this rod is drawn up until
it strikes the stake or one of the rails, when the man can let go of
the &#8220;drawer,&#8221; and it holds itself. The lever is four feet
and three inches long, and two inches square, with the corners taken
off part of the way down, the lower end being rounded for a handle, as
shown in the engraving.</p>

tongue. The thicker part of this pole, for about fifteen inches from
the end, is shaped into a wedge. This is sheathed with a frame made of
iron, half an inch thick and two and a half inches wide, and securely
fastened with screws or bolts. The end should be pointed and slightly
bent upwards. The manner of using this convenient implement is shown in
the illustration.</p>

strong lever&#8212;a stout rail will answer the purpose&#8212;is passed
through the chain, as shown in the engraving, until the end of the rail
catches firm soil. By lifting at the other end of the lever the post is
raised several inches, when both chain and lever are pushed down again
for a second hold, which generally brings the post out. The chain is
furnished with a stout hook at one end, made to fit the links, so that
it can be quickly adjusted to any ordinary post.</p>

hoop-iron may be passed around the splice and securely fastened. The

   <h3>APPLICATION OF WOOD PRESERVATIVES.</h3>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 169.&#8212;Sectional View Of Bored Post.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To prevent decay at the center, as well as of all that part of the
post placed below ground, by use of wood preserving solutions, the
following system is both novel and valuable: It is to have a hole in
the center of the post, from the bottom upward, to a point that shall
be above the ground when the post is in position. Then bore another
hole in the side of the post with a slight inclination downward, making
an opening in the center hole, as shown in <a href="#fig169">figure
169</a>. A wooden plug, two or three inches long, should be driven
snugly into the hole at the bottom of the post, in order to prevent the
escape of any liquid that may be used in the operation. When the posts
are set in an upright position, a preservative<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_113">Page&nbsp;113</a></span> solution may be introduced into
the hole in the side and the centre one filled with it, after which a
cork plug of some kind should be inserted in the side hole, to prevent
evaporation, as well as to keep out dust and insects. The solutions
thus introduced will gradually be absorbed by the surrounding wood,
until all parts along the entire length of the central cavity must
become completely saturated. When the solutions used have been taken up
by the surrounding wood, it will only be necessary to withdraw the cork
or plug, and apply more, if it is thought desirable. A common watering
pot with a slender spout will be a handy vessel to use in distributing
the solutions.</p>

<p>Petroleum, creosote, corrosive sublimate, or any other of the well
known wood preservatives may be used in this way. Telegraph posts might
be prepared in the same way, and if the central reservoirs were kept
filled with petroleum, they would last a hundred years or more. Where a
large number of posts or poles are to be prepared, it would be cheaper
to have the holes bored by steam or horse power than by hand. With very
open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">Page&nbsp;114</a></span>
and porous wood it is quite probable that a hole bored in the side of
the post and above the ground, and deep enough to hold a half pint or
more of creosote or some other similar solution, would answer, but a
central cavity reaching to the bottom, would perhaps, be best.</p>

<p>The advent of wire fences was followed by a call for posts in the
prairie regions, where timber is scarce. Several forms of iron posts
have been devised, of which the leading ones are illustrated herewith.
<a href="#fig170">Figure 170</a> is of iron, one-quarter of an inch
thick and two and a half inches wide, rolled to a curve and pierced
at the proper intervals for the staples, which are to be clinched
on the concave side. The disc, <a href="#fig171">figure 171</a>, is
swedged out of one fourth inch iron. It is sunken a little below the
ground, and the post driven through the curved opening, into<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">Page&nbsp;115</a></span> which it
fits closely. <a href="#fig172">Figure 172</a> is a flat iron bar,
with slots cut diagonally into one side to receive the wire. The post
is supported by two tiles with holes to fit the post, which is thrust
through them.</p>

<p><a href="#fig173">Figure 173</a> is made of angle iron braced at the surface

iron post, with the ground-piece and driving tube to the

notches for the wires, which are held in place with short
pieces of binding-wire, wound around the post. The
ground-piece, which is shown in the middle of the engraving,
is of cast iron, eleven inches long, and five inches
across the top, with two loops for inserting the iron post.
This is driven into the ground, and the iron post driven
through it. At the left of the engraving is shown the
device for driving the post. It is a piece of common
gas-pipe, just large enough to slip easily over the top of
the post, and provided on the top with an iron cap to
receive the blow of the large hammer or maul used in
driving.</p>

them. The three flanges are cast in one solid piece, with a hole
through the centre of any desired form and size. The wings or flanges
are three inch plates, running to sharp edges on the bottom, so that
they can easily be driven into the ground. They may be of any desired
size, larger sizes being required for a light yielding soil than for
a stiff one. <a href="#fig176">Figure 176</a> is an iron post on a
wooden base, for situations where the ground is soft and wet. The
base is preferably of cedar, three to four feet long, four inches
thick, and four to six inches wide. It<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_117">Page&nbsp;117</a></span> is to be sunken in the ground
crosswise with the line of fence. The post is of iron, set and stapled
into the end-piece, as shown in the engraving. Before being put in
place, the whole is saturated with hot coal tar, as a preservative.
There is less call for iron posts than was anticipated when wire fences
first came into general use. It is found that wooden posts can be
delivered in any location reached by railway at less cost than iron
posts.</p>

<p>As board and picket fences have gradually replaced
rail and other primitive fences, useful but inconvenient
&#8220;bars&#8221; have begun to disappear, and tidy gates are seen.
The saving in time required to take down and put up
bars, rather than open and close gates, amounts to a
good deal. A good wooden gate will last a long time.
Gateways should be at least fourteen feet wide. All the
wood used in the construction of the gate should be well
seasoned. It is best to plane all the wood-work, though
this is not absolutely necessary. Cover each tenon with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">Page&nbsp;118</a></span>
thick paint before it is placed in its mortise. Fasten the
brace to the cross-piece with small bolts or wrought nails
well clinched. Mortise the ends of the boards into the
end-posts, and secure them in place with wooden pins
wedged at both ends, or iron bolts. The best are made
of pine fence-boards six inches wide; the ends should be
four by twenty-four inch scantling, although the one at
the latch may be lighter. Five cross-pieces are enough.
The lighter the gate in proportion to strength, the better
it is.</p>

<p class="continued">There is but one right way to brace a gate, and
many wrong ones. The object of bracing is to strengthen the gate, and
also to prevent its sagging. Gates sag in two ways; by the moving
to the one side of the posts upon which the gates are hung, and the
settling of the gates themselves. Unless braced the only thing to
hold the gate square is the perfect rigidity of the tenons in the
mortises; but the weight of the gate will loosen these, and allow
the end of the gate opposite the hinges to sag. It is plain that a
brace placed like that shown in <a href="#fig177">figure 177</a> will
not prevent this settling down. The only opposition it can give is
the resistance of the nails, and these will<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_119">Page&nbsp;119</a></span> draw loose in the holes as
readily as the tenons in the mortises. A brace set as shown at <a
href="#fig178">figure 178</a> is not much better, as the resistance
must depend upon the rigidity of the upright piece in the middle, and
the bolts or nails holding it will give way enough to allow the gate
to sag. The method shown in <a href="#fig179">figure 179</a> is fully
as faulty, while the form shown in <a href="#fig180">figure 180</a> is
even worse.</p>

<p class="continued">It seems strange that any one should brace a
gate in these ways, but it is quite frequently seen attempted. The
only right way to brace a gate is shown in <a href="#fig181">figure
181</a>. The gate may be further strengthened as shown in <a
href="#fig182">figure 182</a>. Before the gate can sag, the brace
must be shortened; for as the gate settles, the points <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em> must come closer together, and this the brace effectually
prevents.</p>

</div>

<p>The posts should be set in such a way that they will not be pulled
to one side and allow the gate to sag. The post should be put below
the line of frost, or else it will be heaved out of position; three
feet in the ground is none too deep. Have a large post and<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">Page&nbsp;120</a></span> make a big
hole for it. Be careful to set the post plumb and stamp the earth
firmly in the hole&#8212;it cannot be stamped too hard. While stamping,
keep walking around the post, so that the earth will be firmed on all
sides. Blocks may be arranged as shown in <a href="#fig183">figure
183</a>; but this is not really necessary, when the posts have been
rightly set, although it may be advisable to take this further
precaution.</p>

<p>To remove the pulling weight of the gate when closed, the swinging
end may rest upon a block; or a pin inserted in the end-piece of the
gate may rest in a slot sawed in the post, or on a shoulder of the
post. <a href="#fig184">Figure 184</a> shows one end of a combination
of two plans&#8212;the iron rod from near the top of the high post
holds the gate while the strain upon the post is lessened by the
opposite end of the closed gate being supported on the other post.</p>

<p>For hanging the gate the best hinges are doubtless those shown in <a
href="#fig185">figure 185</a>. One part passes through the end-piece of
the gate, and is secured by a nut on the end. The other piece is heated
and driven into the post, following the path of a small augur-hole.
Next to this comes the strap hinge, which should be fastened with bolts
or screws. Three easy, cheap ways of supporting the gate are shown in
<a href="#fig186">figures 186</a>, <a href="#fig187">187</a>, and <a
href="#fig188">188</a>. In <a href="#fig186">figure 186</a>, a stout
band of wood, or one of iron, may be used in place of the chain. And in
place of the stool for the reception of the lower end of the end-piece,
a block resting on the ground, or a shoulder on the post, may be
substituted. The mode shown in <a href="#fig187">figure 187</a> is
common in the West. Its construction needs no explanation. By sliding
the gate back until it almost balances it may be carried around with
ease. In <a href="#fig188">figure 188</a>, the fastening, or latch,
must be so arranged as to hold the lower part of the gate in position.
The box of stone renders it easier to move the gate. A heavy block of
wood serves the same purpose.</p>

<p>The posts, <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>, <a href="#fig192">figure

through the battens at <em>e</em>, and to the rear post.</p>

<p>The above describes a cheap, light, durable gate, which in over
twenty-three years&#8217; use has never sagged, though standing in the
thoroughfare of three farms, and also, for years past, used for access
to a sawmill. It is made of the best pine. The hinge is an important
point. It is not only cheap and easily made, but acts as a brace for
the gate at every point, and thus permits the gate to be lightly made.
With this hinge sagging is impossible. A gate of this kind will rot
down first.</p>

<p>Every self-closing gate should be provided with a drop or spring
catch, a suitable bevel for it to strike against and notch to hold it.
Gates opening into the garden or out upon the street, should be so hung
that they will swing either way. <a href="#fig195">Figure 195</a> shows
a hinge and slide for such a gate. In opening the gate from either
side, the arm of the upper hinge slides upon the iron bar, raising the
gate a little as it swings around. When loosed, it slides down without
help, and closes by its own weight. <a href="#fig196">Figure 196</a>

and more ornamental than the plain slide in <a href="#fig195">figure

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 199.&#8212;Lower Hinge Of Gate.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is a style of gate for foot-paths, which is not uncommon, that
keeps itself always closed and latched, by means of a single upper and
double lower hinge, which are to be obtained at most hardware stores.
The lower hinge has two &#8220;thumbs,&#8221; which are embraced by two
open sockets. When the gate is opened, it swings upon one socket and
its thumb, and being thrown off the center,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_127">Page&nbsp;127</a></span> the weight of the gate draws it
back, and swinging too, it latches. A farm gate, entirely home-made,
may be constructed, of which <a href="#fig198">figures 198</a> and <a
href="#fig199">199</a> show the gate and the hinge. The gate is braced
and supported by a stay-strip, extending to the top of the upright,
which forms the upper hinge, <em>f</em> being attached to the top of
the gate-post, by an oak board with a smooth hole in it. The lower
hinge is separately shown at <a href="#fig199">figure 199</a>. It
consists of an oak board, <em>c</em>, an inch and a half thick, into
which the upright, <em>e</em>, is mortised. In this, two sockets are
cut, a foot from center to center. The sockets in this case are three
inches in diameter, and when the gate is in place and shut, they fit
against two stakes of hard wood (locust), two and a half inches in
diameter, <em>d</em>, which being curved, are nailed to the gate-post,
<em>a</em>. A smooth stone, laid across in front of these stakes, takes
the weight of the gate, and relieves in a measure the pressure on the
top of the post. The hinges must be kept well greased, and it is well
to black-lead them also, to prevent creaking.</p>

<p>There are various forms of gates not hung on hinges at all, but
either suspended from above to lift, and provided with counterweights,
or made in the form of movable panels. <a href="#fig202">Figure
202</a> represents a gate for general use,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_130">Page&nbsp;130</a></span> which is peculiarly well adapted
to a region visited by deep snows in winter. The post, firmly set,
extends a little higher than the length of the gate. In front of this
and firmly fastened to it at bottom and top, is a board at sufficient
distance from the post for the gate to move easily between them. An
iron bolt through the large post and the lower end of the tall, upright
gate bar, serves as a balance for the gate to turn on. A rope attached
to the bottom of the gate runs over the pulley and has a weight of iron
or stone that nearly balances the gate. The opened gate is shown in <a
href="#fig203">figure 203</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig204">Figure 204</a> shows a gate balanced in a similar
manner, and arranged so it can be opened by a person desiring to drive
through, without leaving the vehicle. It is suspended by ropes which
pass over pulleys near the top of long posts, and counterpoised by
weights upon the other ends of the ropes. Small wheels are placed
in the ends of the gate to move along the inside of the posts, and
thus reduce the friction. The gate is raised by means of ropes
attached to the center of the upper side of the gate, from which
they pass up to pulleys in the center of<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_131">Page&nbsp;131</a></span> the archway, and then out
along horizontal arms at right angles to the bars which connect the
tops of the posts. By pulling on the rope, the gate, which is but
a trifle heavier than the balancing weights, is raised, and after
the vehicle has passed, the gate falls of itself. In passing in the
opposite direction, another rope is pulled, when the gate is raised as
before.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig206">Figures 206</a> and <a href="#fig207">207</a>
show a gate specially designed for snowy regions. The latch-post, <a
href="#fig205">figure 205</a>, is fixed in the ground and connected
with the fence. It is an ordinary square fence-post, to the side of
which a strip of board is nailed, with a space of an inch between the
board and the post. At the opposite extremity of the gate a heel-post
is set slanting, as shown in <a href="#fig206">figures 206</a> and <a
href="#fig207">207</a>. The gate is made by laying the five horizontal
bars on a barn floor or other level place, with one of the sloping
cross-bars under them and the other above them. Half inch<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">Page&nbsp;132</a></span> holes are
bored through the three thicknesses, carriage bolts inserted from
below, and the nuts screwed on. The gate, thus secured at one end, is
carried to the place where it is to remain and the other ends of the
horizontal bars secured to the heel-post by similar bolts. These should
work freely in the holes. The lower bar is four feet long and the upper
bar seven feet. To the heel of the upper bar is hung a weight nearly
heavy enough to balance the gate, so that it may easily be swung up, as
shown in <a href="#fig206">figure 206</a>, and the weight will keep it
raised.</p>

<p><a href="#fig208">Figures 208</a> and <a href="#fig209">209</a>
illustrate a very cheap way of making a hole through a picket fence in
a place where there is not sufficiently frequent occasion for passing,
to call for a more elaborate gate. Strips of inch board, as wide as
the rails of the fence, and five or six feet long, are nailed to the
upper side of the rails and three pickets are nailed to the strips. The
pieces are then sawed off, beveling, and the pickets detached from the
fence-bars by drawing or cutting the nails. The gate can be lifted up
and set at one side, but cannot be pushed in or pulled out. No rope or
other fastening is required, besides it is almost invisible, which is
many times an advantage. The gate, as lifted out of the fence and set
on one side, is shown in <a href="#fig209">figure 209</a>.</p>

the horizontal bars of the fence by wooden pins shown at <em>a</em>

of two of the pickets serves to keep the gate securely fastened. These
openings are not designed for a regular gate, and could not be used for
the passage of any vehicle, as the horizontal bars would be in the way.
For a back gate to the garden such an opening would frequently be found
convenient and save many steps.</p>

the post, or nailed securely to its top. A cedar block, into which
a two-inch hole has been bored, is partially sunk in the ground to
receive the lower end of the upright piece. A wooden latch is in better

</div>

<p><a href="#fig215">Figure 215</a> is a modernized form of a gate
which has for generations been popular in New England and the Middle
States. In the primitive method of construction, the top bar consisted
of the smoothly trimmed trunk of a straight young tree, with the butt
end projecting like a &#8220;heel&#8221; beyond the post upon which it
turned. Upon its extremity a heavy boulder, or box of smaller stones,
served as a counterweight. In the gate represented herewith the top
stick is of sawn timber, upon the heel of which the large stone is
held by an iron dowel. The other end of the top bar rests, when the
gate is closed, upon an iron pin, driven diagonally into the post, as
shown in the illustration. A smaller iron pin is pushed into the post
immediately above the end of the top bar, to secure the gate against
being opened by unruly animals, which may attempt to get in.</p>

<p>The gate shown in <a href="#fig218">figure 218</a> is suitable for
all weather, but especially useful when there is a deep snow; for
it is easily lifted up above the snow, and kept in place by putting
a pin through holes in the hinge-bar, which is firmly fastened to
the gate post. The hinge-bar should be of<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_139">Page&nbsp;139</a></span> good, tough wood, and made round
and smooth, so that the gate can swing and slide easily. Boards can be
used in place of pickets if preferable. The latch-post to the right,
has a long slot for the latch to work in, instead of a hasp, so that it
can be fastened when the gate is at any height.</p>

<p>The illustrations, <a href="#fig219">figures 219</a> and <a

island of Jamaica. These gates are<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_140">Page&nbsp;140</a></span> twenty-one feet long, each, and
cannot possibly sag, even if any number of small boys swing on them.
In gate <a href="#fig220">figure 220</a> the main post is nine by six
inches; the bars&#8212;marked 2, 3, 5 and 7&#8212;are let in the wood
three inches on the upper side and one and a half inches on the lower.
The tenons, indicated by the dotted lines, go entirely through the
posts, and are fastened with pins. Brace 6 is attached to the upper bar
eighteen inches beyond the center, <em>F</em>; <em>D</em> is a stout
fence wire fastened by a screw nut at <em>E</em>; the wire, <em>B</em>,
is held tightly by the screw hook, <em>A</em>; the iron band, 9, is
an inch thick and is bolted to the post. It works on a pivot one and
a quarter inches in diameter, and which turns on a flat piece of iron
at the bottom of a piece of a one and a half inch iron pipe, which is
soldered with molten lead in the stone, 10. Only hard wood is used
in the construction. In the gate shown in <a href="#fig219">figure
219</a>, the construction differs from the one just described in that
it has a light chain fastened in the shackle, <em>C</em>, and is
screwed firmly at <em>A</em>. It is attached to the post, <em>H</em>,
by a pivot, as seen in our illustration.</p>

<p>It is often convenient and economical, especially in newly settled
regions, where blacksmiths and hardware stores are not at hand, to
supply hinges for gates, to make them of wood. The simplest and most
primitive form is shown in <a href="#fig221">figure 221</a>. A post is
selected having a large limb standing out nearly at right angles. A
perpendicular hole in this secures the top of the rear gate standard.
The foot rests in a stout short post, set against the main post. A
small gimlet hole should extend outward and downward from the lowest
side or point in the hole in the short post, to act as a drain, or the
water collecting in it would be likely to soon rot both the standard
and the short post itself. Another form is to hold the top by a strong
wooden withe. A third form is illustrated in <a href="#fig222">figure
222</a>, in which the top of the standard passes through a short piece
of sawed or split plank, spiked or pinned upon the top of the post.</p>

</div>

<p>The form shown at <a href="#fig223">figure 223</a> is made of a
stout lithe sapling or limb of beech, hickory or other tough hard wood
or, if it is attainable, a piece of iron rod.</p>

   <div class="caption"><p>Fig. 224.&#8212;Gate Without Hinges.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A gate can be made without hinges by having the hanging stile
somewhat longer than the front stile, and making both ends rounded.
The lower one is to work in a hole in the end of a short post raised
so that the soil will not readily get in, and the upper one works in a
hole made in an oak piece attached to the top of the gate post. Gates
of this kind can be made and hung with but little more expense than
bars, and will be found far more convenient and saving of time than the
latter.</p>

hanging two gates to the same post. The post may be of masonry<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">Page&nbsp;144</a></span> and the
hinge bolts pass through the post, thus preventing any sagging. It
is frequently convenient to have gates in the barnyard hung in this
manner, then yards may be shut off one way or the other by simply
swinging the gates.</p>

<p><a href="#fig227">Figure 227</a> represents a balanced gate for
a double driveway. The total length is thirty feet&#8212;sixteen
feet on one side of the supporting post and fourteen feet on the
other. The horizontal top-piece may be of sawn timber, or better
still, of a round pole cut from a straight young tree, the larger
end being on the short side, its additional thickness serving
to counterbalance the longer extremity<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_145">Page&nbsp;145</a></span> of the gate. The vertical strips
of the original gate, from which the sketch was made, were lag-sticks
from an old tread horse-power, and the chain was a part of the remains
of a worn-out chain pump. It is held in place by staples driven into
the vertical pieces, as shown in the illustration. A pin pushed into
the post at either end of the large top bar fastens it securely when
closed.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig230">Figure 230</a> shows a style of double gate,
which has been found very useful on large stock farms, where it is
necessary to drive herds of cattle through it. Two high posts are set
in the ground about twenty feet apart, and a scantling is put on, which
extends from the top of one post to that of the other. A two-inch hole
is bored in the center of this scantling, and a similar hole in a
block<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">Page&nbsp;146</a></span>
of wood, planted firmly in the ground in the center of the gateway.
The middle post of the gate-frame is rounded at each end to fit these
holes, and this post is the pivot on which the gate turns. With this
gate one cow cannot block the passage, besides there is no sagging of
gate posts, as the weight of the gate is wholly upon the block in the
center. To make the latch, <a href="#fig229">figure 229</a>, a bar of
iron one and a half inch wide and eighteen inches long is bolted to one
of the end uprights of the gate, and a similar bar to one of the posts
of the gateway. For a catch, a rod of three-eighth inch iron passes
through a half-inch hole near the end of the bar upon the gateway. This
rod is bent in the form shown in the engraving, and welded. It will be
seen that the lifting of this bent rod will allow the two bars to come
together, and when dropped it will hold them firmly.</p>

<p><a href="#fig231">Figure 231</a> represents a substantial farm gate

of such cattle as have learned to unfasten ordinary gate-latches.
The latches work independently of each other, the wires, <em>b</em>,

class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">Page&nbsp;147</a></span> and then to
the latches <em>e</em>, <em>e</em>. A roguish animal will sometimes
open a gate by raising the latch with its nose, but if one attempt it
with this, it can only raise one latch at a time, always the upper one,
while the lower one remains fastened. As soon as the animal lets go,
the latch springs back and catches again. A hog cannot get through, for
the lower latch prevents the gate from opening sufficiently to allow
it to pass. A cow will find it difficult to open the gate, because
she cannot raise the gate high enough to unlatch it. The latches
<em>e</em>, <em>e</em>, work up and down in the slides <em>c</em>,

between the top and bottom of the slides.</p>

that when the upper end or handle is pushed backward or forward, the
latches both move in the same direction. The construction of the gate,
and the form and arrangement of the latches and lever, are plainly

</div>

<p>The old style slide gate is an unwieldly contrivance, and
the only excuse for its use is its simplicity and cheapness.
Numerous devices have been invented and<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_148">Page&nbsp;148</a></span> patented to make it slide easier
and swing easier, but their cost has prevented them from coming into
general use, and the old gate still requires the same amount of tugging
and heaving to open and close it.</p>

<p><a href="#fig233">Figure 233</a> shows the attachment. The blocks
at top and bottom are hard wood, one inch and a quarter thick. The two
boards should also be of hard wood. Between the boards are one or two
small iron or hard wood wheels, turning upon half inch bolts, which
pass through both boards. The bars of the gate run on these wheels. The
gate complete, with attachment, is shown in <a href="#fig234">figure
234</a>, the gate being closed. To open the gate, run it back nearly to
the middle bar, then swing open. As the attachment turns with the gate,
the lower pivot should be greased occasionally. It is well to fasten a
barbed wire along the upper edge of the top bar, to prevent stock from
reaching over and bearing down on the gate. Where hogs are enclosed, it
is advisable to fasten a barbed wire along the lower edge of the bottom
bar, as it keeps small pigs from passing under, and prevents large ones
from lifting the gate up, or trying to root under.</p>

</div>

<p>The illustrations, <a href="#fig235">figures 235</a> and <a
href="#fig236">236</a>, show a gate very handy for barnyards.
It is fourteen feet wide for ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_149">Page&nbsp;149</a></span> use, and has three short posts.
The middle one is movable. A box of two-inch boards made to fit the
post is planted in the ground; in this the post is set, and can be
removed at pleasure. This post is placed three feet from the outside
one. The hinge is made of hard wood, with a wheel six inches in
diameter, as shown in the engraving. It should be so constructed that
the gate will move freely, but not too loosely. It is supported at the
top by a cap, placed diagonally across, and at the bottom by a block
of locust or cedar under it. The middle uprights of the gate should
be placed a little to one side of the center, so that the gate can be
balanced under the roller. Wooden catches are placed in the middle
post, upon which the gate rests. To open the gate, push it back to
the middle post, elevate the gate slightly, and it will roll down to
the center, where it can be readily opened. <a href="#fig235">Figure
235</a> shows the gate open, and in <a href="#fig236">figure
236</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">Page&nbsp;150</a></span>
it is seen closed. This gate has no latch. A barnyard gate is not
usually opened wide. A space large enough to admit a man or horse is
all that is necessary in most cases. It is more easily opened than
the ordinary gate, and it will stay where it is placed. By cutting a
notch in the third board, and elevating it to the upper catch on the
middle post, a passage is made for hogs and sheep, excluding larger
animals.</p>

saw out corresponding notches in the uprights;<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_151">Page&nbsp;151</a></span> make these one and a half
inch, or half the width of the strips. The bottom notch is two and a
half inches from the end of the upright, and the upper one nine and a
half inches from the top end. Fit the strips into the notches. There
is then a space of one inch between the strips, into which put inch
strips, so as to make all solid, and fasten together with carriage
bolts. Braces three by one and a half inches are inserted, and held in
place by bolts or wrought nails. Bore as many holes in the end-pieces
for one-quarter inch eye-bolts, as it is desired to have wires. Twist
the wire firmly into the bolts on one upright, and secure the other
end to the corresponding bolts on the upright at the opposite end. In
stretching the wires, pass them alternately on opposite sides of the
center piece, and fasten in place by staples. This will, in a measure,
prevent warping. By screwing down the bolts with a wrench, the wires
may be drawn as tightly as desired. The hinges are to be put on with
bolts, and any sort of fastening may be used that is most convenient.
Barbed or smooth wire may be used.</p>

into the uprights, the bolts of the hinges strengthening the joints.
The barbed wires prevent animals from reaching over and through the
gate. To put in and tighten the wires, bore a three-eighth inch hole
in the upright, pass the wires through, one or two inches projecting,
plug up tightly with a wooden pin, and bend down the ends of the wire.
Measure the distance to the other upright, and cut the wire two inches
longer. Pass the wire through the whole and tighten with pincers. When
the wire is stretched, plug up with a wooden pin, and then bend down
the wire. If the wire stretches, it can be tightened very easily.</p>

downward to <em>b</em>, near the middle of the upper cross-bar, and

put together with carriage bolts, upon which the joints play freely.
The end of the gate, <em>a</em>, is made of two boards, and the post,

notched. The diagonal piece, <em>c</em>, is fastened at <em>d</em>, by
means of a bolt through it and the lower board. The end, <em>a</em>,
of the diagonal piece, is shaped to fit the notches, by means of which
the gate can be raised and lowered. It can also be used as a passage
for pigs between fields, by simply raising the gate sufficiently to let
them go through. A board, not shown in the engraving, is tacked to the
notched board, to prevent the diagonal piece from slipping out of its
place.</p>

</div>

<p>Some cows become so expert, they can lift almost any gate latch.
To circumvent this troublesome habit, latches made as shown in <a
href="#fig246">figure 246</a> will fill this bill exactly. It is a
piece of iron bar, drawn down at one end, and cut with a thread to
screw into the gate post. A stirrup, or crooked staple, made as shown,
is fitted by a screw bolt and nut to the bar. A small bolt must be
driven in to keep the stirrup from being thrown over. A projecting slat
on the gate, when it is shut, lifts the stirrup and holds the gate.
This latch is too much for breechy cows, and they are never able to get
&#8220;the hang of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A simple catch for a gate may easily be made from a<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">Page&nbsp;158</a></span> piece of
seasoned hickory, or other elastic wood, cut in the shape as shown
at <em>a</em> in <a href="#fig247">figure 247</a>. This is fastened
strongly to the side of the gate, with the pin, <em>c</em>, working
through the top loosely, so that it will play easily. The catch,
<em>b</em>, is fastened to the wall or post, as the case may be. The
operation will be easily understood from the illustration, and it will
be found a serviceable, sure, and durable contrivance. The gate cannot
be swung to without catching, and it may swing both ways.</p>

</div>

<p>A very simple and convenient style of fastening is illustrated
in <a href="#fig248">figures 248</a> to <a href="#fig251">251</a>.
It can be made of old buggy springs, or any flat steel, and should
be one inch broad by three six-tenth inch thick, and about eighteen
inches long, at the distance of four inches from the lower end.
The lever is slightly bent, and has two screw or bolt holes for
fastening, <a href="#fig248">figure 249</a>. Eight inches of the
top portion is rounded and bent at right angles. The upper part
passes through a narrow mortise in the head-post of the gate <a
href="#fig248">figure 248</a>. A flat staple, large enough to go over
the spring holds it in place. An iron hook,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_159">Page&nbsp;159</a></span> <a href="#fig248">figure
250</a>, driven into the post, holds the latch. A wooden lever, bolted
to the top board of the gate, <a href="#fig251">figure 251</a>, enables
a person on horseback to open or close the gate. This latch can be
applied to any kind of a gate, and is especially desirable in yards or
gardens, when, by the addition of a chain and weight, one may always
feel that the gate is securely closed. The latch does not cost more
than fifty cents, and if properly made and put on will last as long as
the gate.</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#fig252">figure 252</a> is represented a
style of gate latch in use in some Southern States. It
possesses marked advantages,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_160">Page&nbsp;160</a></span> for certain purposes, over
others. It holds to an absolute certainty, under all circumstances,
and by allowing the latch pin to rest on the bottom of the slot in the
post, it relieves the hinges and post from all strain. The latch may
be formed by a common strap-hinge, made to work very easily, and the
pin should be either a strong oak one or an iron bolt or &#8220;lag
screw.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig253">Figure 253</a> shows a latch which cannot
be opened by the most ingenious cow or other animal. The latch
of wood slides in two iron or wood bands screwed to the<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">Page&nbsp;161</a></span> gate. It is
moved by a knob between the bands, which also prevents it from going
too far. The outer end is sloping and furnished with a notch. It slides
through a mortise in the gate post, indicated by dotted lines. When
the gate is closed, the latch is slid through the mortise, and the
drop-pin, which plays vertically in two iron bands, is lifted by the
slope on the latch, and drops into the notch. It can be opened only by
lifting the drop-pin, and sliding back the latch at the same time.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig254">Figure 254</a> shows a very ingenious and reliable
form of latch. The curved tail must be thin enough and sufficiently
soft to admit of bending, either by a pair of large pincers or a
hammer, just so as to adapt it to the passage of the pin bolted through
the front stile of the gate. As the gate closes, the latch lifts out
and the tail-piece advances. The catch-pin cannot possibly move out,
unless the whole end of the gate moves up and forward.</p>

<p>Continual use, more or less slamming, and the action of the
weather, make the gate settle somewhat, but the illustration,
<a href="#fig255">figure 255</a>, shows a hinge which obviates
this trouble. The upper hinge is made of a half-inch rod,
about sixteen inches long, with an eye on one end, and a long
screw-thread cut upon the other. This<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_162">Page&nbsp;162</a></span> thread works in a nut, which
nut has a bolt shank and nut, whereby it is firmly attached to the top
bar of the gate. If the gate sags at all, it must be simply lifted off
the thumbs, and the hinge given a turn or two in the nut; and the same
is to be done in case of subsequent sagging. The hinge bolt must, of
course, have some opportunity to move in the stile, and must be set
long enough at first to allow the slack to be taken up whenever found
necessary.</p>

<p>Regular posts and bars at a passageway through a wire fence are
inconvenient and unsightly. A good substitute for a gate is illustrated
in <a href="#fig256">figure 256</a>. Light galvanized iron chains have
a &#8220;swivel&#8221; near the end, by which they may be loosened or
tightened, so as to be of just the right length, and a snap-hook at the
other. These are both shown of larger size in <a href="#fig257">figures
257</a> and <a href="#fig257">258</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_163">Page&nbsp;163</a></span> The chains are attached by
screw-eyes to the posts, and should correspond in number, as well as
in position, with the wires. Thus they appear to be a continuation
of the same, and as they are larger, they appear to the animals to
be stronger, and even more dangerous than barbed wire&#8212;hence
are avoided. A short rod of iron may be made to connect them at the
hook-ends, and so in opening and closing the way, they may all be moved
at once.</p>

</div>

<p>A cheaper and simpler form of wire gate is shown in <a
href="#fig259">figures 259</a> and <a href="#fig260">260</a>. It
consists of the same number of strands as in the adjoining fence,
attached to a post in the ordinary way at one end, while the other
wire ends are secured to an iron rod. This rod is pointed at the lower
end, and when the gate is closed, as seen in <a href="#fig259">figure
259</a>, this end passes down through a loop, and the upper end is
secured to a hook. In opening the gate, the rod is loosened and swings
out, when the sharp end is thrust into the earth, or a hole in a
wooden block set in the ground at the proper place to receive it.</p>

<p><a href="#fig261">Figure 261</a> shows a somewhat similar
arrangement. The gate wires are fastened to one post with staples, and
attach the loose ends to a five-foot pole. To shut the gate, take this
pole or gate-head and put the lower end back of the lower pin, and
spring the upper end behind the one above. If the wires are all of the
right length, they will be taut and firm. Two slats fastened to the
gate wires will keep them from tangling. A short post set at one side
of the gateway may be found convenient to hold the gate when open.</p>

<p>Wickets and stiles are convenient passageways through or over fences

gate &#8220;always open and always shut,&#8221; and not apt to get out

shown in <a href="#fig262">figure 262</a>. <a href="#fig263">Figure

a wheel-barrow or small animals to pass. To go through it, a person
simply steps into the bow, swings the gate away from him, and swings
it back in passing out. There is no latch to fasten, and no fear of
the entry of livestock. Similar wickets may be constructed of wood for
board fences.</p>

href="#fig265">figure 266</a> is really the most convenient form. The
objection to both of these stiles is, that there is no actual closing
of the passage. Calves, sheep and pigs, not to mention dogs, work their
way through. To prevent this, the gate-stile, <a href="#fig267">figure
267</a>, was invented. It has a small gate swinging on the middle
post, but stopped in its movement by the end-posts of the <span
class="verdana">V</span>. A person can pass by stepping well into the
<span class="verdana">V</span> and moving the gate by him, where he has
free exit. This form is efficient, but inconvenient.</p>

small animals to pass, but it is easily hung so that it will always
remain closed, and so offer no temptation to animals on the outside.
At night, or when not in use, a wire ring or withe-hoop thrown over
the top of the post and the upright part of the gate-frame, will
securely fasten it. To make the gate swing shut, all that is necessary
is to set the eye of the lower hinge of the gate well out towards the
outside. In <a href="#fig270">figure 270</a> we give a neat <span

<div class="chapter">
   <h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII. <br />FENCE LAW.</h2>
</div>
<h3>FENCING OUT OR FENCING IN.</h3>

<p>The common law of England, which to a large extent became the
law of the original States, bound no one to fence his land at all.
Every person is bound under that law to fence his own cattle in,
but not bound to fence other cattle out. Every owner of domestic
animals is liable for injury committed by them on the lands of
others, even though the land was wholly unfenced. But this feature
of the English common law was not suited<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_171">Page&nbsp;171</a></span> to the conditions which
surrounded the early settlers in any part of this country. So long as
any region is sparsely settled, the amount of unoccupied land is so
much greater than the occupied, that it is cheaper to fence stock out,
than to fence it in. Hence the English common law in regard to fencing
has been superseded by statute in many of the States. In others it
has always remained in force, or has been revived by later statutes.
There is such great diversity on this point in the statutes of the
several States, that, to quote from Henry A. Haigh&#8217;s excellent
&#8220;Manual of Farm Law,&#8221; &#8220;every one having occasion to
look up any point of law, should ascertain the statutory provisions
concerning it from some official source. Do not depend upon this book
or any other book for them, because they are liable to change, and do
change from year to year; but go to your town clerk or justice of the
peace, and examine the statutes themselves.&#8221;</p>

<div class="section">
   <h3>DIVISION FENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>The legal obligations of adjoining owners to build and maintain
division fences, rests entirely upon the statutes of the respective
States, save in cases where long usage has created prescriptive
rights, or special agreement exists. Such fences are to be built on
the boundary line, the expense to be borne equally by the parties,
or each one shall make and maintain half the fence. If they cannot
agree, or either refuses or neglects to do his share, the statutes
provide methods by which the matter may be determined. In some of
the States, two or more public officers, called fence-viewers, are
elected annually in each township, whose duties, as prescribed
by statute, are, when called upon, to hear and decide questions
relating to fences in their respective towns. In other States,
these duties are performed by overseers of highways or selectmen,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-officio</span>. Whenever any owner or<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">Page&nbsp;172</a></span> occupant of
land refuses to build or maintain half the division fence, or cannot
agree with his adjoining neighbor as to which portion they shall
respectively maintain, the fence-viewer may be called. Upon being
so called, the fence-viewer shall upon reasonable notice, and after
viewing the premises, determine and assign the respective portions
of the fence to be maintained by each. The assignment when so made
and recorded by the proper officer, becomes binding upon the present
and all subsequent owners of the land. (2 Wis. 14). When by reason
of a brook, water-course, or natural impediment, it is impracticable
or unreasonably expensive to build a fence on the true line between
adjacent lands, and the owners thereof disagree respecting its
position, the fence viewers may, upon application of either party,
determine on which side of the true line, or whether partly on one side
and partly on the other, and at what distances, the fence shall be
built and maintained, and what portions by either party, and if either
party refuses or neglects to build and maintain his part of the fence,
the other shall have the same remedy as if the fence were on the true
line. When a division fence shall be suddenly destroyed or prostrated
by fire, winds or floods, the person who ought to repair or rebuild the
same should do so in ten days after being notified for that purpose,
and in the meantime he will be liable for damages done by estrays.</p>

<p>There is no legal obligation in any of the States, upon any
proprietor of uncultivated, unimproved and unoccupied land, to keep up
division fences. When a proprietor improves his land, or encloses land
already improved, the land adjoining being unimproved, he must make
the whole division fence, and if the adjoining proprietor afterward
improves his land, he is required to pay for one half the division
fence, according to the value thereof at that time. The laws of the
respective States are not uniform touching the obligations to maintain
one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">Page&nbsp;173</a></span>
half a division fence after the owner of the land ceases to improve it.
In Rhode Island and some other States, the proprietors are required to
maintain these respective proportions, whether they continue to improve
their land or not. In Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and several other
States, it is provided that if one party lays his lands common, and
determines not to improve them, he may, upon giving due notice, cease
to support such fences. But in most of the States, he must not take
away any part of the division fence belonging to him and adjoining the
next enclosure, provided the other party will allow and pay for his
part of such fence. If the parties cannot agree as to its value, it may
be decided by two or more fence-viewers. Where adjacent land is owned
in severalty and occupied in common, and either party desires to occupy
his in severalty, and the parties disagree, either party may have the
line divided by the fence-viewers, as in other cases.</p>

<p>Owners of adjoining lands may agree between themselves as to the
building and maintenance of division fences, and such agreements are
valid, whether they are in accordance with the law or not. In some
States such an agreement, if in writing, and filed with the clerk of
the township, becomes binding upon all subsequent holders of the land.
If not in writing, however, such an agreement may be terminated by
either of the parties at pleasure.</p>

<div class="section">
   <h3>HIGHWAY FENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>Under the common law, the land owner is under no obligation to fence
his land along a public highway. But in Missouri, Iowa, Illinois,
Oregon, and some other Western and Southern States, the common law
rule has been modified by statutes depriving the land-holder of his
action for trespass, unless he maintains sufficient fences around
his land. In these States, the owner of<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_174">Page&nbsp;174</a></span> land must enclose it with
sufficient fences if he would cultivate it. Even where there is no
such statutory provisions, it is practically necessary to maintain
highway fences, as a protection against cattle which are driven along
the highway. The use of barb wire for fencing along the public roads
has given rise to questions for which there were no precedents. A case
was decided in the United States Circuit Court, at Watertown, New
York, December 17, 1885. The action was brought by a horse breeder
to recover damages from his neighbor for injuries sustained by the
plaintiff&#8217;s horse from a barbed wire fence, stretched along the
roadside in front of the defendant&#8217;s premises. A non-suit was
granted on the ground that the animal received the injuries through
the contributory negligence of its owner. Among the rulings of the
court was one permitting the plaintiff to be questioned, to show the
fact that he had on his own farm a similar fence, but of sharper form
of barb. The court further held that it might be a question whether it
would not be competent testimony to show the common employment of barb
wire fence in that region, and held that for the purpose of this case,
a barbed wire fence, if properly constructed upon the highway, must be
deemed a legal fence.</p>

<p>It may be said in a general way, that though there is no legal
obligation resting on the land-holder to maintain fences along the
public highway, he neglects to do so at his own risk and peril.</p>

<div class="section">
   <h3>WHAT IS A LEGAL FENCE?</h3>
</div>

<p>What shall be necessary to constitute a legal and sufficient
fence is specifically defined by the statutes of the several
States, but there is no uniform rule among all. In Maine, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts and many other States, it is provided
that all fences four feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_175">Page&nbsp;175</a></span> and in good repair, consisting
of rails, timber, boards, or stone wall, and all brooks, rivers, ponds,
creeks, ditches, hedges, and other things deemed by the fence viewers
to be equivalent thereto, shall be accounted legal and sufficient
fences. In Vermont, Connecticut, Michigan, and some other States, a
legal fence must be four and a half feet high. In Missouri post fences
must be four and one half feet high, hedges four feet high, turf
fences four feet high, with ditches on each side three feet deep in
the middle and three feet wide; worm fences must be five and one-half
feet high to the top of the rider, or if not ridered, five feet to the
top of the top rail, and must be rocked with strong rails, poles or
stakes; stone or brick fences must be four and one-half feet high. In
New York the electors of each town may, by vote, decide for themselves
how fences shall be made, and what shall be deemed sufficient. No part
of the fence law is so definitely regulated by the statutes of the
respective States as the requirements of a legal fence. In all cases
where practical questions arise involving this point, it is best to
consult the statutes, which will be found in the office of the township
clerk.</p>

<div class="section">
   <h3>RAILROAD FENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>In nearly every State, railroad companies are required by statute
to construct and maintain legal and sufficient fences on both sides of
their roads, except at crossings of public highways, in front of mills,
depots, and other places where the public convenience requires that
they shall be left open. The legal obligations of railroad companies
to fence their roads rest wholly upon such statutes. In New Hampshire
it is provided that if any railroad company shall neglect to maintain
such fences, the owner of adjoining land may build them, and recover
double the cost thereof of the company. It is generally held by the
courts in all the States that, in the absence of such fences<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">Page&nbsp;176</a></span> the railroad
company is liable for all resulting damage to livestock, and no proof
of contributory negligence on the part of the owner of livestock is
allowed as a plea in defence, the statute requiring such fences being
a police regulation. When the railroad company has built a sufficient
fence on both sides of its road, it is not liable for injuries which
may occur without negligence on its part. If the fence is overthrown
by wind or storms, the company is entitled to reasonable time in which
to repair it, and if cattle enter and are injured, without fault on
the company&#8217;s part, it is not liable. If cattle stray upon the
track at a crossing of a public road, and are killed, the owners
cannot recover damages, unless the railroad company is guilty of gross
negligence or intentional wrong. A law in Alabama making railroad
companies absolutely liable for all stock killed on the tracks, was
held to be unconstitutional.</p>

<h3>STRENGTH OF BRIDGES.</h3>

<p>Bridge building is a profession of itself, and some of the great
bridges of the world are justly regarded as among the highest
achievements of mechanical science and skill. But it is proposed to
speak in this work only of the cheap and simple structures for spanning
small streams. The measure of the strength of a bridge is that of its
weakest part. Hence, the strength of a plain wooden bridge resting upon
timber stringers or chords, is equivalent to<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_177">Page&nbsp;177</a></span> the sustaining power of the
timbers in the middle of the span. The longer the span, other things
being equal, the less its strength. The following table shows the
sustaining power of sound spruce timber, of the dimensions given, at a
point midway between the supports:</p>

<p>A stick of timber twenty feet between supports, will bear a load in
its center only one half as great as a timber of the same dimensions,
ten feet between supports. Thus four timbers six by twelve inches, in a
span of sixteen feet, would bear a load of eight tons; in a twelve foot
span, the same timbers would support a weight of nearly twelve tons.</p>

</div>

<p>The above is the initial strength of the timbers which support the
weight of the superstructure, and any load that it may have to sustain.
But in bridge building these timbers are reinforced by trusses or
braces, which add greatly to the sustaining power of the bridge.</p>

<p><a href="#fig275">Figure 275</a> shows the simplest form of a
self-supporting bridge, which will answer for spans of from ten to
fifteen feet in length. The braces, <em>c</em>, <em>c</em>, reach from
near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">Page&nbsp;178</a></span>
the end of the sill to about four feet above the center. The truss
rod, <em>d</em>, is one inch in diameter for short bridges up to two
inches for longer spans; it is provided with an iron washer at the
top. The rod passes through the sill, and a cross-sill, <em>e</em>,
which passes under the main sills, thus adding firmness to the
whole structure. Logs, <em>f</em>, <em>f</em>, are placed against
the ends of the sills to keep them in place, and where the wheels
will first strike them instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_179">Page&nbsp;179</a></span> floor plank, thus greatly
equalizing the pressure. <a href="#fig276">Figure 276</a> represents
a modification of the above. The two truss-rods and braces give
the structure greater strength and solidity, adapting it for spans
eighteen feet in length. For the latter length, sills should be of good
material, ten inches wide and fourteen inches deep, with three middle
sills of about the same size.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#fig277">Figure 277</a> is a more improved style of bridge,
the truss serving both to support the structure, and as a parapet.
The top railing is of the same width as the sill, about one foot.
The lower side may be cut away, giving the bridge a more finished
appearance. The railing at the center is six inches thick, and three
inches at the ends. The tie, <em>h</em>, is full width and four inches
thick. A bridge of this kind will answer for heavy traffic, even if
twenty feet in length. The bolt truss, in <a href="#fig278">figure
278</a>, is adapted for a span of twenty-five feet. This makes a
bridge of great firmness. Each set of truss-rods support a cross-sill.
The road planks are laid crosswise of the bridge. The middle sills
are sometimes half an inch lower than<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_180">Page&nbsp;180</a></span> those along the sides, and
should be four or five in number. The ends of the planks fit closely
against the inside of the truss sills, thereby keeping the planks
securely in place.</p>

</div>

<p>A common method of bracing is from below as shown in <a

the braces are liable to be carried away by ice or floods.</p>

</div>

<p>If the sills of a bridge are laid directly upon the dry
walls of an abutment, or upon a heavy plank, the jar of passing
teams soon displaces some of the stones, and brings undue strain
upon certain portions of the wall. To avoid this, abutments are
best made of cut stones, and laid in cement. A wooden bent for
the support of the ends of the bridge may be made as shown in <a
href="#fig280">figure 280</a>. The whole should be constructed of
heavy timber, pinned together. A coat of white lead should cover the
interior surface of all joints. The number and position of the posts
of the wooden abutment are seen in the engraving. A log should be
laid upon the wall at <em>m</em>, to relieve<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_181">Page&nbsp;181</a></span> the bridge from the shock of the
passing wagons. A center pier should be avoided as much as possible,
as it offers serious obstruction in floods, and ice, drift<span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">Page&nbsp;182</a></span> wood and
other floating matter become piled against it, seriously imperiling
the entire structure.</p>

<p class="continued">But in cases where the length of the bridge is
so great as to require one or more piers, they may be constructed on
the plan shown in <a href="#fig281">figure 281</a>, or in case the
bottom is so soft as to render the mudsill insecure, a line of piles
supporting a cross-timber, as in <a href="#fig282">figure 282</a>. A
strong, reliable parapet or railing should always be provided. The want
of one may be the cause of fatal accidents to persons and horses. <a
href="#fig283">Figure 283</a> gives a side view of a good railing, and
<a href="#fig283">figure 284</a> shows the manner of bracing the posts
to the ends of the cross-beams. They should be thus braced at every
alternate post of the railing. The floor should be double, as shown in
<a href="#fig285">figure 285</a>, the lower planks laid diagonally, and
the upper layer crosswise.</p>

<p>For small gullies which cross roadways or lanes in farms, and
are not the beds of constant streams, but are occasionally filled
with surface water, a very simple bridge is sufficient. One like
that shown in <a href="#fig286">figure 286</a> is as good as any.
The sills, <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>, are sunk in a trench dug against
the bank and at least to the level of the bed of the creek. The
cross-sills, <em>b</em>, <em>b</em>, are not mortised into them, but
simply laid between them. The pressure is<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_183">Page&nbsp;183</a></span> all from the outside, hence it
will force <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>, tighter against the ends <em>b</em>,
<em>b</em>, which must be sunk a little into the bed of the creek at
its lowest point. The posts are mortised into the sills, <em>a</em>,
<em>a</em>, and plates, <em>c</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>,
<em>d</em>, upon which the planks are laid. Props may be put against
the lower sides of the posts to hold the bridge against the stream.</p>

<p>A cheap but practicable bridge is shown in <a href="#fig287">figure
287</a>. Two logs are laid across the gully, their ends resting on
the banks, and to them puncheons or planks are spiked to form the
bridge. Stout posts, well propped and reaching above the highest water
mark, are placed against the lower side of the logs. If the creek
rises, the bridge, being free, will be raised on the surface of the
water, while the posts will prevent its being carried away. Should it
not rise with the water, it opposes so little surface to the current
that the posts will hold it fast.</p>

<p>No feature adds more to the appearance of ornamental grounds
than tasteful bridges. A stream or narrow channel connecting two
parts of a small sheet of water, affords an opportunity for the
introduction of a bridge. In the absence of such features a bridge
may be thrown across a dry ravine. Whatever style may be adopted,
should harmonize with the general character of the surroundings. An
elaborate bridge of wood or masonry would be as much out of place on
grounds unadorned by other structures, as a rude rustic one would be
near highly finished summer-houses and other architectural features.
On most grounds a neat rustic bridge, something like the one shown in
<a href="#fig288">figure 288</a>, would be in good keeping with its
environments. Such bridges may be made of red<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_185">Page&nbsp;185</a></span> cedar logs and branches, resting
upon stone abutments. Where boulders are abundant, a stone bridge,
something like <a href="#fig289">figure 289</a>, may be built at very
little cost, and will last for generations. The pleasing effect of
rustic or other ornamental bridges is enhanced by training Virginia
creeper or other climbing plants upon them.</p>

<p>A culvert under a road is, in effect, a short bridge. The simplest
form of plank culvert, resting upon stone abutments, is shown in <a
href="#fig290">figure 290</a>. Such a structure is cheaply built,
and serves a good purpose while the wood-work remains sound. But the
planks wear out and the timbers decay, requiring frequent renewing.
Where stone is abundant it is much cheaper in the end to build wholly
of stone, as in <a href="#fig291">figure 291</a>. After the abutments
are built, a course of flat stone, along each side, projects inward
from six to ten inches, as at <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>, which are covered
with a broad stone, <em>b</em>. Where the stream to be crossed is so
narrow that a row of single stones is sufficient to cover the opening,
a culvert like that seen in <a href="#fig292">figure 292</a> is cheaply
made. Such structures will remain serviceable for a generation, if the
foundations are not undermined by the action of the water.</p>

</div>

<p>Where flat stones enough cannot be easily procured, culverts may
be built of concrete. The abutments are first made, as in other
cases; then empty barrels or sugar hogsheads, according to the
capacity of the opening, are fitted in, or better still, a temporary
arch is made of rough, narrow boards. The concrete of cement, sand
and gravel, is then prepared and poured in, temporary supports of
lumber having been fixed across each end of the culvert to keep
the concrete in place until it hardens.<span class="pagenum"><a
id="Page_187">Page&nbsp;187</a></span> Small stones may be mixed with
the concrete as it is poured into place, and the whole topped off with
a row of them. This protection of stones on the top is valuable, in
case the covering of earth is worn or wasted away at any time while it
is in use. For a longer culvert a flattened arch is made of concrete,
as shown in <a href="#fig293">figure 293</a>. Light timbers are laid
across, the ends resting lightly on the abutments. Across the middle of
these a round log is placed to support the crown of the arch. Elastic
split poles are sprung over all, and upon these are nailed thin narrow
boards, extending lengthwise of the culvert. The ends being temporarily
protected, the concrete is mixed and poured on, as before. As soon
as the concrete has become thoroughly well &#8220;set,&#8221; the
light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">Page&nbsp;188</a></span>
cross-sticks are cut in two and the temporary work removed.</p>

<p class="continued">A cross-section, showing another form of
concrete culvert, and the method of construction, are shown in <a
href="#fig294">figure 294</a>. Such a culvert is more easily built than
the last, but is not as strong. The best and most durable culvert is
of stone, with a regular half-round arch. Such work can only be done
properly by a regular mason, but in the end it is cheaper, where the
stone can be obtained, than any kind of make-shift.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
